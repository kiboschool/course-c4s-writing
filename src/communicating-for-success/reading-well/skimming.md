*Estimated Time: 30 minutes*

Skimming is a reading strategy that involves quickly moving your eyes over a text in order to get a general idea of its content. It is often used when you want to get a broad understanding of a text without reading it in great detail. Skimming can be useful when you need to quickly gather information from a long or complex text, or when you want to identify the main points or key ideas in a text.

## Why should you skim?

Skimming can be useful for a number of reasons. Here are a few examples:

- If you need to quickly gather information from a long or complex text, skimming can help you identify the main points or key ideas without having to read the entire text in detail.

- If you're not sure whether a text is relevant to your needs, skimming can help you quickly determine whether it contains the information you're looking for.

- If you're short on time and need to get through a large amount of reading material, skimming can help you quickly identify which texts are worth reading in more depth.

- If you're studying for an exam and need to review a large amount of material, skimming can help you quickly identify the most important information and focus your study time on the most relevant information.

- Skimming can also be a useful skill in everyday life, such as when you're scanning a menu at a restaurant or browsing a webpage to find specific information.

## When should you skim?

There are certain texts that lend themselves to skimming better than others. It is typically less beneficial to skim novels, poetry, and short stories or texts that do not have text features such as such as tables of content, chapter or section summaries, headings, bold words, pictures, and diagrams. Non-fiction texts, like textbooks, journal articles, and essays are typically full of these kinds of text features and are more suited for skimming.

Skimming can also be a good tool for conducting research and writing papers. Typically, when researching or writing, you will not need to read every word of every text closely, but will benefit more from skimming while evaluating your sources or identifying information important to your work.

Finally, know your context. There may be some texts that you are better off reading closely and thoroughly. Some professors specifically tell you that they include small details from the textbook on exams. You may have some classes that are just difficult to understand, and you may find that reading closely helps you comprehend concepts better. Before skimming, spend some time thinking about your classes, professors, and needs to determine if you have any texts you may need to read more closely.

## When should you not skim?

There are some situations when skimming is not the best reading strategy. Here are a few examples:

- If you need to understand every detail of a text, skimming is not a good idea. Skimming involves quickly moving your eyes over the text and may cause you to miss important details or nuances.

- If the text contains complex ideas or difficult vocabulary, skimming may not be the best strategy. Skimming involves quickly moving your eyes over the text, so you may not have enough time to fully understand the ideas or vocabulary.

- If the text is not well-organized or the main points are not clearly stated, skimming may not be effective. Skimming relies on your ability to identify the main points or key ideas in a text, so if the text is not well-organized or the main points are not clearly stated, you may not be able to accurately understand the content of the text.

- If you're reading for enjoyment or to gain a deep understanding of the text, skimming is not the best strategy. Skimming involves quickly moving your eyes over the text and may not allow you to fully appreciate the content or fully understand the ideas.

- If you're not familiar with the topic or subject matter of the text, skimming may not be effective. Skimming relies on your prior knowledge and understanding of the topic, so if you're not familiar with the subject matter, you may not be able to accurately understand the content of the text.

## Skimming Methods

- **Method 1**: Read the title, introduction, and conclusion of the text. These sections often provide a general overview of the text and can help you understand the main points or key ideas.

- **Method 2**: Read the first sentence of each paragraph. This can help you quickly identify the main points or key ideas in each paragraph and get a general understanding of the text's content.

- **Method 3**: Scan the text for key words or phrases that are bolded, italicized, or highlighted. These words or phrases are often used to emphasize important ideas, and reading them can help you quickly understand the main points of the text.

- **Method 4**: Look for headings, subheadings, and other visual cues, such as bullet points, lists, or tables, that can help you quickly understand the organization and structure of the text.

- **Method 5**: Read the first and last sentences of each paragraph. This can help you understand the main points or key ideas in each paragraph and get a sense of how the ideas in the paragraph relate to the overall content of the text.
