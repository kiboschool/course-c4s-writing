## How We Read

Have you ever thought about what actually happens when you read? Watch the following two videos to learn more about how reading actually happens. 

> 📺 Watch the following video on the science behind reading.

From the video:
  
"It's because all you're ever seeing is your internal model of the outside world. You're not seeing the world as it is because it actually takes time for your eye to move from one place to another. So what happened in that time? Well, it turns out your brain says, “Okay, I'm going to fill in the gap with whatever I land in.” When your eyes land on the thing. You've got this gap in time, and so your brain essentially retrospectively fills that in.”
 
- David Eagleman

One of the most interesting conclusions from the above video is that our brain dosen't process exactly what is on a page, instead it processes pieces of what is on the page and fills in the gaps with what it thinks is there. 🤯
