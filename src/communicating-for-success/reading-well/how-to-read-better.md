Reading is an important skill for success in personal, academic, and professional contexts. Being able to read allows you to access a large amount of written information. This can include everything from books, newspapers, and magazines, to instructions, street signs, and menus. Without the ability to read, you would be unable to fully participate in many aspects of modern society. Reading is also important for personal growth and development. Reading allows you to learn new things, expand your knowledge, and develop your critical thinking skills, and can also be a source of enjoyment and relaxation. Furthermore, reading is essential for academic success. In school, students are expected to read and understand a wide variety of texts, including textbooks and other written materials. Being able to read and comprehend these texts is essential for doing well in university. 

While we know that reading is critical skill, you may ask yourself, "what does it mean to read well?"

To read well means to be able to read and understand written materials accurately and effectively. This includes being able to:

- Read quickly and accurately.

- Comprehend the meaning of the text.

- Make connections between the ideas in the text and your own knowledge and experiences. 

This can be challenging in academic and professional settings, when the volume and complexity of the texts that you are required to read is high. Therefore. it is worth being intentional about improving your approach to reading, and in this section we will explore some ways to help you read better.

Summary of the SQ3R Framework:

- **S = Survey:** Quickly preview the material to get an overall sense of what it is about. Look at headings, subheadings, and any other organizational features.
- **Q = Question:** Turn the headings and subheadings into questions, and try to answer them based on what you already know. This will help you focus on the most important information and think about how it fits into your existing knowledge.
- **R = Read:** Read the material carefully, paying attention to the answers to the questions you generated. Take notes as you go along to help you remember key points.
- **R = Recite:** After you have finished reading, try to explain the main ideas to someone else or to yourself. This will help you consolidate your understanding and identify any areas where you need further clarification.
- **R = Review:** Review your notes and any other materials you have gathered, and test yourself on the material to make sure you have a good understanding of it.

Here is an example of how you could use SQ3R when reading a chpater of a programming textbook:
  
- **Survey:** Begin by quickly scanning the chapter to get an overview. Look at the headings and subheadings, any bold or italicized words, and any accompanying graphics such as code samples or flowcharts. This will give you a general idea of what the chapter is about and how it is organized.
- **Question:** Now, turn the headings and subheadings into questions. For example, if the chapter is about loops in Python, some questions you might ask might include: What is a loop in Python? How do I use the for loop? How do I use the while loop? Asking questions like these will help you focus on the most important information and think about how it fits into your existing knowledge.
- **Read:** Now, read the chapter carefully, paying attention to the answers to the questions you generated. As you read, take notes on key points and any new information you encounter. It can be helpful to type out code samples as you read to help you understand how they work.
- **Recite:** After you have finished reading, try to explain the main ideas to someone else or to yourself. You might do this by summarizing the chapter in your own words, or by explaining the difference between for and while loops to a friend. This will help you consolidate your understanding and identify any areas where you need further clarification.
- **Review:** Review your notes and any other materials you have gathered, and test yourself on the material to make sure you have a good understanding of it. You might do this by creating flashcards with key terms and concepts, or by writing code samples to practice using loops in Python.

While SQ3R is a useful framework, as mentioned in the video, you don't need to follow is perfectly in order to get the main benefits of the approach. The general point of the framework is for you to **read actively**!
