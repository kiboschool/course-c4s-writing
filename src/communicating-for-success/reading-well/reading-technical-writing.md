# Reading Technical Writing

*Estimated Time: 1.5 hours*

---

As you develop your technical skills and launch your technical career, you will be required to read a variety of documents that are specific to the technology industry. In this section we will dive into discussing a couple of these types of documents, and explore some tips for how to approach reading them effectively. We will cover:

- Design Docs
- Product Requirement Documents 
- Technical Documentation
- Code
- Technical Research Papers

## Design Docs 

> 📺 Watch the following video from Nabila, one of our Kibo mentors, that describes what a design doc is.

## Code

<aside>

🗣 **"Indeed, the ratio of time spent reading versus writing is well over 10 to 1. We are constantly reading old code as part of the effort to write new code.”**

― Robert C. Martin

> 📺 You can watch this video that delves deeper into how to read code, which is equally as applicable for reading and debugging your own code. (**Note:** This video is long, but I highly encourage you to watch it!)

“Your prior knowledge influences what you see. Not even what you think, but literally what you can remember. So if you are working with someone that has a different level of experience. That knows more about a certain programming language or a certain code base than you or less than you. You are not even looking at the same thing.”

- Felienne Hermans
