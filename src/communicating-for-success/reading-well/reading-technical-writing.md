# Reading Technical Writing

*Estimated Time: 1.5 hours*

---

As you develop your technical skills and launch your career, you will be required to read a variety of documents that are specific to the technology industry. In this section we will dive into discussing a couple of these types of documents, and explore some tips for how to approach reading them effectively. We will cover:

- Design Docs
- Product Requirement Documents 
- Technical Documentation
- Code
- Technical Research Papers

## Design Docs 

> 📺 Watch the following video of Nabila, one of the Kibo mentors, describing what a design doc is.

## Product Requirement Documents

> 📺 Watch the following video on software planning and technical documentation

## Code

<aside>

🗣 **"Indeed, the ratio of time spent reading versus writing is well over 10 to 1. We are constantly reading old code as part of the effort to write new code.”**

― Robert C. Martin

> 📺 Watch this video that delves deeper into how to read code. This is especially useful for reading and debugging your own code. (**Note:** This video is long, but I highly encourage you to watch it from timestamp 03:20 - 37:30)

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xZZ74d8XUl0"  title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;"></iframe></div> 

<aside>
“Your prior knowledge influences what you see. Not even what you think, but literally what you can remember. So if you are working with someone that has a different level of experience. That knows more about a certain programming language or a certain code base than you or less than you. You are not even looking at the same thing.”

- Felienne Hermans

Here is a summary of the three types of confusion when reading code that are mentioned in the video, along with the proposed solutions:

1) **Long-term memory issues** - these occur when you encounter concepts, variable names, syntax, etc. that you are not familiar with.
    - Solution: STOP, look up the thing that you don’t know, practice retrieving the information. 

2) **Short-term memory issues** - these occur when you don't have the required prior knowledge available in your short-term memory.
    - Solution: Restructure the code so that it more closely matches your prior knowledge.

3) **Working memory issues** - these occur when the amount of information that you need to juggle at a given time to understand something overloads the capacity of your working memory.
    - Solution: Support your working memory by using visuals like tables, or create a process that helps you decompose and step through through different parts of the code (e.g. printing intermediary values to understand how the code is functioning).
