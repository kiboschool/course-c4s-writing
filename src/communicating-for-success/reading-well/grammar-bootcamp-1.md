<details>
   <summary> Click to see a list of commonly confused words and their explanations. </summary>

-  Fewer. Less.
    
    - Fewer is used for things you can count. (e.g. problems, injuries)
    
    - Less is used for things you can’t count.  (e.g. happiness, love, kindness)

- Who; That.
    
    - Who is used to reference people.
   
   - That is used to reference things.
   
   - You could also use "that" when referring to people, but "who" is strongly preferred.

- I; Me.
    
    - You can test the sentence to see which one is correct by removing the other people in the sentence, and listening to see if "me" or "I" sounds more correct.
   
   - Example: Do you think the teacher is too strict with my friends and [I or me]?
       
      - Test 1: Do you think the teacher is too strict with I?
       
      - Test 2: Do you think the teacher is too strict with me?
      
      - Test 2 sounds correct, so the sentence should use "me"

- Lie; Lay.
      
    - Lie (present tense verb).  Meaning to recline or rest on a surface.
        - Past tense of this verb is also lay.

     - Who. Used to refer to the subject of a sentence.
     
     - Whom. used to refer to the object of a verb or preposition.
     
     - To determine when your pronoun is the object of a verb or preposition, try substituting “he” or “she” and “him” or “her.”
          - If “he” or “she” fits, you should use who.
          - If “him” or “her” fits, you should use whom.
          - You will likely need to rearrange the sentence while you test it. And if the sentence is a question, try answering the question to see if he/she or him/her makes more sense.

- Among; Between
        
     - Among is used when talking about people or things that are not distinct, and are instead viewed as a group.
     
     - Between is used when referring to one-to-one relationships. The elements that are being referred to must all be separate and distinct.

## Spelling

<aside>
  
One essential aspect of good writing is accurate spelling. With computer spell checkers, spelling may seem simple, but these programs fail to catch every error. Spell checkers identify some errors, but writers still have to consider the flagged words and suggested replacements… Computer spell checkers are useful editing tools, but they can never replace human knowledge of spelling rules, homonyms, and commonly misspelled words 

- Excerpt from Writing for Success - [Section 4.2 Spelling](https://open.lib.umn.edu/writingforsuccess/chapter/4-2-spelling/)
  
</aside>


> 📺 Watch the following video about the challenges of spelling in English

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zdRY0x2x6PQ" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;"></iframe></div>

As discussed in the video, English spelling can be challenging due to the lack of consistency in many spelling conventions. As you work on improving your spelling, here are some common spelling errors that people tend to make:

1. Single or Double Letters (e.g. accommodation)

2. Silent Letters (e.g. thumb)

3. Position of "i" and "e" (e.g. receive)

4. Phonetic spelling (i.e. spelling a word the way it sounds) (e.g. receipt v. receit)

5. Similar sounding words (e.g. accept v. except)

6. Malaproprisms (e.g. taxing v tasking)
