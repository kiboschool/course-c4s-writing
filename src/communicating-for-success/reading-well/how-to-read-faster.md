To read fast means to be able to read quickly and accurately. This means being able to quickly process the words on the page and understand their meaning, without sacrificing accuracy or comprehension. Reading fast is an important skill that can be useful in a number of situations. For example, it can help you save time when you are reading lengthy texts or have a lot of material to cover. It can also help you keep up with the pace of a conversation or discussion when reading aloud. In order to read fast, you need to develop your reading comprehension skills and improve your ability to process information quickly. 


Here are a few tips to help you learn to read faster:

- **Develop your reading comprehension skills**: In order to read quickly, you need to be able to understand the material you are reading. This means practicing your reading comprehension skills and learning how to identify the main ideas, key details, and relationships between ideas in a text.

- **Use skimming and scanning**: Skimming is a technique that involves quickly reading the main points of a text, while scanning is a technique that involves quickly looking for specific information in a text. These techniques can help you read quickly without sacrificing accuracy or comprehension.

- **Increase your familiarity with the material**: The more familiar you are with the material you are reading, the easier it will be to read quickly. Try to read widely and expose yourself to a variety of texts, so that you are more familiar with the language and content of what you are reading.

- **Practice regularly**: As with any skill, the more you practice reading fast, the better you will become. Set aside time to practice reading quickly, and try to gradually increase your speed over time.
