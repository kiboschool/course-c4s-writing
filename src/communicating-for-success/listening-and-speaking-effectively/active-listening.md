# Listening Well

*Estimated Time: 3 hours*

---

> ‚ö†Ô∏è This lesson on listening is adapted from Chapter 5 of [Communication in the Real World](https://open.lib.umn.edu/communication/part/chapter-5-listening/). If you would like to explore the concept of listening more deeply, please read the chapter and associated reference sources.

We live in a world in which we are constantly bombarded by messages. This requires us to read and listen well, so that we can interpret these messages accurately. However, just as we discussed at the start of this course, people often overlook reading and listening as forms of communication. But you can't write or speak effectively, if you are unable to accurately receive and interpret information. As you heard in the video in the Motivation section, we spend approximately 60% of our communication time listening, but we only retain 25% of what we hear. Therefore, we are not very efficient in this process of "making meaning from sound". 

However, we need to be. Listening is critical to correctly completing tasks in school and at work. It helps us to interact appropriately with others to build strong social connections. It can also allow us to receive important feedback from other's about how we come across. Therefore, efffective listening is critical to achieving our academic, personal, and professional goals.

## How Listening Occurs

Consider the following situations:

- **Scenario 1**: You are studying in your room with your headphones on and your mother suddenly comes in. You take out your headphones and hear her   say angrily, "I have been calling your name for the last 5 minutes, why weren't you listening to me."
- **Scenario 2**: You are in a lecture and the teacher asks you to summarize the key point they just made, but although you were paying attention you can't answer correctly because you didn't understand their main point. Your teacher says, "Why didn't you listen to what I was saying."
- **Scenario 3**: At the end of your monthly meeting with your advisor, they ask you to summarize the action items the two of you just discussed and agreed on for the next month. However, you realize that you don't remember what the action items are anymore. Your advisor wonders aloud, "were you not listening during our discussion?"
- **Scenario 4**: You are a huge Ronaldo fan, and your classmate is a massive Messi fan. Every time you discuss football together, they try to convince you that Messi is better, and while you listen patiently to their arguments, you always tell them that you disagree and still think that Ronaldo is better. After the fiftieth time that the two of you have had this argument they say, "You never listen to me."
- **Scenario 5**: Your brother keeps borrowing your laptop without asking, so you decide to ignore him for a few days. He comes into your room to ask what you are cooking for dinner. Although you can hear him, you refuse to look at him or speak to him. He gets upset and asks "Why aren't you listening to me?"

What is going on in each of these scenarios? On the surface, the person you are communicating with has acused you of not listening. But each situation is very different. 

- In scenario 1, you never received the message because your headphones blocked you from hearing. 
- In scenario 2, you heard the information, but didn't understand it well enough to act on what you heard.
- In scenario 3, you heard and understood the information at one point, but when asked to recall it, you could not.
- In scenario 4, you heard and understood the information, but evaluated it differently than the speaker intended.
- In scenario 5, you heard and understood the information, but refused to respond.

These scenarios point to the reality than listening is far more complicated than we realize! 

One common misconception is that hearing = listening. However, this is not the case. Hearing is just one part of listening in which you receive auditory information. However, actual listening requires you to process the information you receive so you can understand and respond to it appropriately.

> üì∫ Watch the following video for an introduction to listening.

</aside>
  
As described in the video and textbook chapter, listening occurs through a process involving the following actions:

<details>
  <summary> Receiving </summary>

This step of the listening process involves taking information through audio and visual channels. It might surprise you that visual channels are part of listening. However, what we see influences how we interpret what we hear.
    
</details>

<details>
  <summary> Interpreting </summary>

In this step we combine the information that we have received and try to make meaning so that we can understand it and connect it to what we already know.
  
</details>

<details>
  <summary> Recalling </summary>
  
Recall is our ability to retrieve the information we hear. 
  
If we don't interprete information that we receive, it only sits in our sensory storage, which can only hold around 4 seconds of unsorted information. However, once we interpret and move information into one of our other memory stores, we can hold on to it for a litte longer. But surprisingly not that much longer. 
  
Short-term memory can only hold information for 20 - 60 seconds before the information either expires or moves to our long-term memory. If information manages to make it to our long term memory it can be stored indefinitely. However, this transfer to long-term memory is complex, and only occurs when we effectively integrate new information with our current knowledge. 
  
Working memory is an additional temporary memory store  we can use to hold and process information in periods of high cognitive demand. However, working memory is limited and can only hold around 3 - 5 chunks of information at a time. 
  
As a result of all this, our ability to recall what we hear is shockingly poor. We are only able to recall about 50% of what we hear immediately after we hear it, this drops to 35% after 8 hours, and just 20% after a day.
  
</details>

<details>
  <summary> Evaluating </summary>

Evaluation requires us to take information that we have received or recalled and make a value judgement on it. This requires us to use our critical thinking skills to determine things like the accuracy, credibility, completeness, desirability, and worth of the information.
  
</details>

<details>
  <summary> Responding </summary>
 
Responding consists of sending verbal and nonverbal cues to indicate our level of attentiveness and understanding of what we are receiving. This could include using verbal cues such as saying, "uh-huh", "sure", "right", when someone is speaking, or nonverbal cues like nodding your head, maintaining eye contact, or leaning towards the speaker.

Other responding behaviours include:

- Paraphrasing: in which you rephrase the received information in your own words and say them back to the speaker. E.g., ‚ÄúWhat I heard you say was‚Ä¶‚Äù or ‚ÄúIt seems like you‚Äôre saying‚Ä¶". 

- Questioning: in which you ask questions to clarify misunderstandings or gain deeper clarity on the received information.

## Types of Listening

Listening is something we do every day, so it might not be obvious that there are many different types of listening that you can employ depending on the situation. The type of listening that we use greatly impacts the response we receive from other people. 

> üì∫ Watch the following video to learn about the main types of listening

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/G1ULTB5wtjQ" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;"></iframe></div>


As mentioned in the video, there are two main types of listening:
- **Discriminative Listening** - listening to isolate a particular stimulus and determine what it is.
- **Comprehensive Listening** - listening to understand and recall information.

There are also numerous specific listening types that are characterized by the goal of the listening. These include:
  - **Informational Listening** - listening to learn.
  - **Empathetic/Therapeutic Listening** - listening to understand what the speaker is thinking or feeling.
  - **Critical Listening** - listening to analyze and evaluate what is being communicated.
  - **Appreciative Listening** - listening for enjoyment.
  - **Rapport Listening** - listening to build relationships.

All these subtypes of listening require discriminative and comprehensive listening as prerequisites.

## Listening Styles

As mentioned in the video at the start of this lesson, there are different styles that people take when listening. These include:

- **People-oriented listeners** - Focused on offering support, and evaluating the state of the speaker.
- **Action-oriented listeners** - Focused on the plan and what next steps will be needed based on what they are hearing.
- **Content-oriented listeners** - Focused on listening to complex information and processing it in all of it's nuance.
- **Time-oriented listeners** - Focused on how long an exchange is taking more than they are on any other element of the message.

## Reflection

> ü™û Answer the following questions in the padlet below:
> 1) Which one (or more) of the listening styles do you use? Why do you think that is?
> 2) Have you ever used an the wrong listening style for a given situation? What was the consequence?

<div style="border:1px solid rgba(0,0,0,0.1);border-radius:2px;box-sizing:border-box;overflow:hidden;position:relative;width:100%;background:#F4F4F4"><iframe src="https://padlet.com/curriculumpad/listening-styles-kpbde1wt3nop31ve" frameborder="0" allow="camera;microphone;geolocation" style="width:100%;height:608px;display:block;padding:0;margin:0"></iframe></div>

## Barriers to Listening

There are a variety of causes for poor listening. Some people may be more focused on their own thoughts and ideas and may not fully pay attention to what others are saying. Others may be easily distracted by external stimuli (e.g. noises) or may not be interested in the topic being discussed. Some people may also have difficulty processing spoken information at the pace that the speaker expects. These challenges can be thought of as barriers to listening and can impact any of the stages of the listening process.

<aside>
  
- At the **receiving stage**: incoming stimuli can be blocked by noise or physical barriers. 
- At the **interpreting stage**: complex or abstract information may make it hard to reach understanding. 
- At the **recalling stage**: natural limits to short term and working memory, as well as issues with transfer to long term memory, and problems with concentration and attention may interfere with remembering. 
- At the **evaluating stage**: personal biases and prejudices can intefere with how well we analyze and evaluate information. 
- At the **responding stage**: poor paraphrasing and questioning skills can result in misunderstanding.

## Active Listening

**Active listening** refers to the process of matching visible positive listening behaviors (showing the speaker that you are listening) with positive cognitive listening practices (actually listening to understand the speaker). As a result, you are able to fully hear and comprehend what someone is saying. Active listening can help address many of the listening barriers that were discussed earlier.

> üì∫ Watch the following video for an introduction to active listening.

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/z_-rNd7h6z8"  title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;"></iframe></div>

> üìñ Read the following chapter on [Active Listening](https://opentextbc.ca/studentsuccess/chapter/active-listening/)
 
<aside>

**Active Listening Behaviors**

1) Waiting for the speaker to finish speaking before responding; don‚Äôt interrupt.

2) Asking questions and asking for clarification about what the speaker is saying.

3) Reiterating in your own words what you think they meant in order to clarify meaning and understand intentions.

4) Paying attention to body language, gestures, and tone of voice.

5) Focusing and giving undivided attention; avoid distractions.

6) Showing sensitivity to the speaker‚Äôs point of view.

7) Being attentive to the speaker, which is demonstrated through eye contact, body language, and facial expressions.
