# Listening

*Estimated Time: 3 hours*

> ‚ö†Ô∏è This lesson on listening is adapted from Chapter 5 of [Communication in the Real World](https://open.lib.umn.edu/communication/part/chapter-5-listening/). If you would like to explore the concept of listening more deeply, please read the chapter and associated reference sources.

We live in a world in which we are constantly bombarded by messages. This requires us to read and listen well, so that we can interpret these messages accurately. However, just as we discussed at the start of this course, people often overlook reading and listening as forms of communciation. But you can't write or speak effectively, if you are unable to accurately receive and interpret information. As you heard in the video in the Motivation section, we spend approximately 60% of our communication time listening, but we only retrain 25% of what we hear. Therefore, we are not very efficient in this process of "making meaning from sound". 

However, we need to be. Listening is a critical to correctly completing tasks in school and at work. It helps us to interact appropriately with others to build strong social connections. And can allow us to receive important feedback from other's about how we come across. Therefore, fffective listening is critical to achieving our academic, personal, and professional goals.

## How Listening Occurs

Consider the following situations:

- Scenario 1: You are studying in your room with your headphones on and your mother suddenly comes in. You take out your headphones and hear her   say angrily, "I have been calling your name for the last 5 minutes, why aren't you listening to me."
- Scenario 2: You are in a lecture and the teacher asks you to summarize the key point they just made, but although you were paying attention you can't answer correctly because you didn't understand their main point. Your teacher says, "Why didn't you listen to what I was saying."
- Scenario 3: At the end of your monthly meeting with your advisor, they ask you to summarize the action items the two of you just discussed and agreed on for the next month. However, you realize that you don't remember what the action items are anymore. Your advisor wonders aloud, "where you not listening during our discussion?"

What is going on in each of these scenarios? On the surface, the person you are communicating with has acused you of not listening. But each situation is very different. 

- In scenario 1, you never received the message because your headphones blocked you from hearing. 
- In scenario 2, you heard the information, but didn't understand it well enough to act on what you heard.
- In scenario 3, you heard and understood the information at one point, but when asked to recall it, you could not.

These scenarios point to the reality that listening is far more complicated that we realize! 

One common misconception is the hearing = listening. However, this is not the case. Hearing is just one part of listening in which you receive auditory information. However, actual listening requires you to process the information you receive so you can understand and respond to it appropriately.

> Listening is the learned process of receiving, interpreting, recalling, evaluating, and responding to verbal and nonverbal messages.

Listening occurs through a process involving the following actions:

<details>
  <summary> Receiving </summary>

This step of the process involves taking information through audio and visual channels. It might suprise you that visual channels are part of listening. What we see influences how we interpret what we hear.
    
</details>

<details>
  <summary> Interpreting </summary>

In this step we combine the information that we have received and try to make meaning so that we can understand it and connect it to what we already know.
  
</details>

<details>
  <summary> Recalling </summary>
  
Recall is our ability to retrieve the information we hear. 
  
If we don't interprete information that we receive, it only sits in our sensory storage, which can only hold around 4 seconds of unsorted information. However, once we interpret and move infomration into one of our other memory stores, we can hold on to it for a litte longer. But suprisingly not that much longer. 
  
Short-term memory can only hold information for 20 - 60 seconds before the information either expires or moves to our long-term memory. If information manages to make it to our long term memory it can be stored indefinitely. However, this transfer to long-term memory is complex, and only occurs when we effectively integrate new information with our current knowledge. 
  
Working memory is an additional temporary memory store  we can use to hold and process in periods of high cognitive demand. However, working memory is limited and can only hold around 3 - 5 chunks of information at a time. 
  
As a result of all this, our ability to recall what we hear is shockingly poor. We are only able to recall about 50% of what we hear immediately after we hear it, this drops to 35% after 8 hours, and just 20% after a day.
  
</details>

<details>
  <summary> Evaluating </summary>

Evaluation requires us to take information that we have recieved or recalled and make a value judgement on it. This requires us to use our critical thinking skills to determine things like the accuracy, credibility, completeness, desirability, and worth of the information.
  
</details>

<details>
  <summary> Respnding </summary>
 
Responding consists of sending verbal and nonverbal cues to indicate our level of attentiveness and understanding of what we are receiving. This could include using verbal cues such as saying, "uh-huh", "sure", "right", when someone is speaking, or nonverbal cues like nodding your heading, maintaining eye contact, or leaning towards the speaker.

Other responding behaviours include:

- Paraphrasing: in which you rephrase the received information in your own words and say them back to the speaker. E.g., ‚ÄúWhat I heard you say was‚Ä¶‚Äù or ‚ÄúIt seems like you‚Äôre saying‚Ä¶". 

- Questioning: in which you ask questions to clarify misunderstandings or gain deeper clarity on the received information.

## Barriers to Listening

- Appeal of the speaker
- Content of the message
- Clarity of the language
- External distractions
- Internal distractions (e.g. emotions)
- Selective perception
- Faking attention

## Types of Listening

Listening is something we do every day, so it might not be obvious that there are many different types of listening that can employ. The type of listening that we choose to use greatly impacts our communication style, the success of our communication, and the response we receive from other people. 

> üì∫ Watch the following video to learn about the main types of listening

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/G1ULTB5wtjQ" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;"></iframe></div>


Here is a summary of some of the main types of listening (Wolvin & Coakley, 1993):

- Discriminative Listening - listening to isolate a particular stimulus and determine what it is.
- Informational/Comprehensive Listening - listening to understand and recall information.
- Appreciative Listening - listening to appreciate what you are hearing.
- Empathetic/Therapeutic Listening - listening to understand what the speaker is thinking or feeling.
- Critical Listening - listening to analyze and evaluate what is being communicated.

## Listening Styles

As mentioned in the video at the start of this lesson, there are different styles that people take when listening. These include:

- People-oriented listeners - Focused on offering support, and evaluating the state of the speaker.
- Action-oriented listeners - Focused on the plan and what next steps will be needed based on what they are hearing.
- Content-oriented listeners - Focused on listening to complex information and processing it in all of it's nuance.
- Time-oriented listeners - Focused on how long an exchange is taking more than they are on any other element of the message.

| **Listening Style** | **Concerns** | **Purpose** | **Strengths** | **Weaknesses** | **Usefull Application** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| People-oriented | Emotional states of others | Offering support in interpersonal relationships | Characterized as caring and understanding. Can create a space where people can make themselves vulnerable without fear reprecussion or judgement.|  | Interpersonal communication involving emotional exchanges |
| Action-oriented | Action that needs to take place in regards to a received message. Frustrated by disorganization, because it detracts from the possibility of actually doing something. | Want to formulate an organized way to initiate that action | Very effective when a task needs to be completed under time, budgetary, or other logistical constraints | Often not appropriate for emotional interpersonal exchanges | One research study found that people prefer an action-oriented style of listening in instructional contexts. |
| Content-oriented | Information of the message.  | Drawing understanding and making meaning. | Enjoy high perceived credibility because of their thorough, balanced, and objective approach to engaging with information. |  | Skilled informational and critical listeners that find success in careers like academia, law, and politics.|
| Time-oriented | Time limits and timelines of the communication. |  |  |  |  |

‚ÄúPeople hear what you say but don‚Äôt understand because their reference point, values and experience are different from yours.‚Äù

There are a variety of reasons why some people may be bad at listening. Some people may be more focused on their own thoughts and ideas and may not fully pay attention to what others are saying. Others may be easily distracted or may not be interested in the topic being discussed. Some people may also have difficulty processing spoken information, whether due to a learning disability or other factors. Additionally, some people may be more comfortable speaking than listening and may have difficulty paying attention to others when they are not the ones speaking.
