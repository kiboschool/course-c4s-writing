*Estimated Time: 3 hours*

> ⚠️ This lesson on listening is adapted from Chapter 5 of [Communication in the Real World](https://open.lib.umn.edu/communication/part/chapter-5-listening/). If you would like to explore the concept of listening more deeply, please read the chapter and associated reference sources.

We live in a world in which we are constantly bombarded by messages. This requires us to read and listen well, so that we can interpret these messages accurately. However, just as we discussed at the start of this course, people often overlook reading and listening as forms of communciation. However, you can't write or speak effectively, if you are unable to accurately receive and interpret information. As you heard in the video in the Motivation section, we spend approximately 60% of our communication time listening, but we only retrain 25% pf what we hear. So we are not very efficient in this process of "making meaning from sound." However, we need to be.

“People hear what you say but don’t understand because their reference point, values and experience are different from yours.”

There are a variety of reasons why some people may be bad at listening. Some people may be more focused on their own thoughts and ideas and may not fully pay attention to what others are saying. Others may be easily distracted or may not be interested in the topic being discussed. Some people may also have difficulty processing spoken information, whether due to a learning disability or other factors. Additionally, some people may be more comfortable speaking than listening and may have difficulty paying attention to others when they are not the ones speaking.
