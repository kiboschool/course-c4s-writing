Elevaotr pitches can be used in a variety of situations, including:

- General networking 
- Introducing yourself at the start of an interview
- Pitching your project or ideas to different stakeholders 

The information that you include in your elevator pitch will differ, depending on your purpose. However, the overall goal of it being a short introduction to create interest still holds.

In this section, we will focus on two types of elevator pitches:

- Introducing yourself 
- Introducing your ideas
