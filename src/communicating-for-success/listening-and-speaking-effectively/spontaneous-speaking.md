# Speaking Well
*Estimated time: 1 hour*

Speaking is the process of communicating through spoken language. It involves using one's voice to convey a message to an audience, typically in the form of words and sentences. However, speaking is more than just saying words. It involves considering the needs and interests of the audience, choosing the right words and tone of voice, and organizing the content of the message in a clear and logical way. Therefore, speaking actually contains multiple components:

1) The words that you use. (The verbal message)

2) How you say those words. (The paraverbal message)

How your speech is interpreted is also heavily influenced by nonverbal cues. So the third component os speakings actually:

3) Your body language. 

In this section, we will focus on the first two components of speech (your words and your voice), and we will discuss body language in the next section.

## Your Words

Ewhen you are just speaking in everyday situations, you should know what you want to accomplish (i.e., know your purpose) and know who you are speakign to (i.e., analyze your audience). The same tips that you learnt for writing in Sections 3.4 and 3.5 can be used here. Make sure the words you select will be understood by your audience, and serve your purpose. Additionally, speaking in shorter sentences will make it easier for people to process what you are saying and understand you better.
