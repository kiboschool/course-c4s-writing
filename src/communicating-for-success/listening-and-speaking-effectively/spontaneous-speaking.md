# Speaking Well
*Estimated Time: 3 hours*

---

Speaking is the process of communicating through spoken language. It involves using one's voice to convey a message to an audience, typically in the form of words and sentences. However, speaking is more than just saying words. It involves considering the needs and interests of the audience, choosing the right words and tone of voice, and organizing the content of the message in a clear and logical way. Therefore, speaking actually contains multiple components:

1) The words that you use. (The verbal message)

2) How you say those words. (Vocalics = The vocal nonverbal message)

3) Your body language and other nonvocal nonverbal cues.

In this section we will explore each of the three aspects of speaking introduced above, so that you can feel more confident in achieving your speaking goal of **ensuring your message is accurately heard, understood, and acted upon.**

Note, that this section is not specifically directed towards public speaking or presenting. However, all the information provided here is still applicable to planned speaking contexts.

## Your Words

When you are speaking and interacting with other people in everyday situations, you should know what you want to accomplish (i.e., know your purpose) and know who you are speaking to (i.e., analyze your audience). The same tips that you learnt for writing in Sections 3.4 and 3.5 can be used here. Make sure the words you select will be understood by your audience and serve your purpose. Also similar to writing, selecting the correct level of formality is important. Ensure you use the appropriate level of formality based on the purpose, audience, and context of your spoken interaction. Finally, speaking in shorter sentences will make it easier for people to process what you are saying and understand you better.

## What is Nonverbal Communication?

While we tend to focus on the words that we say as the most important part of speaking, they actually account for less than 10% of the meaning that people attribute to our message. Vocalics (the vocal nonverbal message) account for around 40% of the meaning, and body language and other nonvocal nonverbal cues account for over 50% of the meaning that is made.
