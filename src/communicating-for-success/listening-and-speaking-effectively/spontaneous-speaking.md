# Speaking Well
*Estimated Time: 3 hours*

---

Speaking is the process of communicating through spoken language. It involves using one's voice to convey a message to an audience, typically in the form of words and sentences. However, speaking is more than just saying words. It involves considering the needs and interests of the audience, choosing the right words and tone of voice, and organizing the content of the message in a clear and logical way. Therefore, speaking actually contains multiple components:

1) The words that you use. (The verbal message)

2) How you say those words. (Vocalics = The vocal nonverbal message)

3) Your body language and other nonvocal nonverbal cues.

In this section we will explore each of the three aspects of speaking introduced above. So that you can feel more confident in achieving your speaking goals, which is **to ensure your message is accurately heard, understood, and acted upon.**

Note, that this section is not speicifically directed towards public speaking or presenting. However, all the information provided here is still applicable to planned speaking contexts.

## Your Words

When you are speaking and interacting with other people in everyday situations, you should know what you want to accomplish (i.e., know your purpose) and know who you are speaking to (i.e., analyze your audience). The same tips that you learnt for writing in Sections 3.4 and 3.5 can be used here. Make sure the words you select will be understood by your audience and serve your purpose. Also similar to writing,  selecting the correct level of formality is important. You should  ensure that yo uuse the correct level of formality based on the purpose, audience, and context of your spoken interaction. Finally, speaking in shorter sentences will make it easier for people to process what you are saying and understand you better.

## What is Nonverbal Communication?

While we tend to focus on the words that we say as the most important part of speaking, they actually for less than 10% of the meaning that people attribute to our message. Vocalics (the vocal nonverbal message) accounts for around 40% of the meaning, and body language and other nonvocal nonverbal cues account for over 50% of the meaning that is made.

> 📖 Read the following chapter to learn more about [nonverbal communication](https://open.lib.umn.edu/communication/chapter/4-2-types-of-nonverbal-communication/).

Here is a summary of the types of nonverbal communication:

| Name | Type | Description |
| -- | -- | -- |
| Vocalics | Voice | Vocalized nonverbal components of speech |
| Kinesics | Body | Body movements and posture |
| Haptics | Body | Touch behaviors that convey meaning |
| Proxemics | Body | The use of space and distance within communication |
| Chronemics | Other | Influence of time on our communication |

Nonverbal communication has a variety of functions during speech, these include:

<details>
  <summary> Complementing </summary>
  
**Definiton:** Nonverbal behavior that is used in combination with the verbal portion of the message to emphasize the meaning of the entire message. 

**Example:** A child is exclaiming, “I’m so excited” while jumping up and down. The child’s body is further emphasizing the meaning of “I’m so excited.”

</details>
    
<details>
  <summary> Contradicting </summary>

**Definiton:** When individual’s nonverbal communication is the opposite of their verbal communication. 
  
**Example:** A friend says, “The concert was amazing,” but the friend’s voice is monotone. A response might be, “oh, you sound real enthused.” Communication scholars refer to this as “contradicting” verbal and nonverbal behavior. When contradicting occurs, the verbal and nonverbal messages are incongruent. This incongruence heightens our awareness, and we tend to believe the nonverbal communication over verbal communication.

</details>
  
<details>
  <summary> Accenting </summary>

**Definiton:**  A form of nonverbal communication that emphasizes a word or a part of a message. The word or part of the message accented might change the meaning of the message. 
  
**Example:** Accenting can be accomplished through multiple types of nonverbal behaviors. Gestures paired with a word can provide emphasis, such as when an individual says, “no (slams hand on table), you don’t understand me.” By slamming the hand on a table while saying “no,” the source draws attention to the word. Words or phrases can also be emphasized via pauses. Speakers will often pause before saying something important. Your professors likely pause just before relaying information that is important to the course content.

</details>
  
<details>
  <summary> Repeating </summary>

**Definiton:** Nonverbal communication that repeats the meaning of verbal communication assists the receiver by reinforcing the words of the sender. 
  
**Example:** Nodding one’s head while saying “yes” serves to reinforce the meaning of the word “yes,” and the word “yes” reinforces the head nod.

</details>
  
<details>
  <summary> Regulating </summary>

**Definiton:** Reseachers Paul Ekman and Wallace Friesen state that regulators are “acts which maintain and regulate the back-and-forth nature of speaking and listening between two or more interactions” (1969, p. 82). 
  
**Example:** You may notice your friends nodding their heads when you are speaking. Nodding one’s head is a primary means of regulating communication. Other behaviors that regulate conversational flow are eye contact, moving or leaning forward, changing posture, and eyebrow raises, to name a few. You may also have noticed several nonverbal behaviors people engage in when trying to exit a conversation. These behaviors include stepping away from the speaker, checking one’s watch/phone for the time, or packing up belongings. These are referred to as leave-taking behaviors. Without the regulating function of nonverbal behaviors, it would be necessary to interrupt conversational content to insert phrases such as “I have to leave.” However, when interactants fail to recognize regulating behavior, verbal communication will be used instead.

</details>
  
<details>
  <summary> Substituting </summary>

**Definiton:** At times, nonverbal behavior serves to replace verbal communication altogether. Substituting nonverbal behaviors must be understood within a context more often than not. 
  
**Example:** A friend may ask you what time it is, and you may shrug your shoulders to indicate you don’t know. At other times, your friend may ask whether you want pizza or sushi for dinner, and you may shrug your shoulders to indicate you don’t care or have no preference.
