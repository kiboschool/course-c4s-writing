# Speaking Well
*Estimated Time: 1.5 hour*

---

Speaking is the process of communicating through spoken language. It involves using one's voice to convey a message to an audience, typically in the form of words and sentences. However, speaking is more than just saying words. It involves considering the needs and interests of the audience, choosing the right words and tone of voice, and organizing the content of the message in a clear and logical way. Therefore, speaking actually contains multiple components:

1) The words that you use. (The verbal message)

2) How you say those words. (Paralanguage)

3) Your body language and other nonvocal nonverbal cues.

In this section we will explore each of the three aspects of speaking introduced above. So that you can feel more confident in achieving your speaking goals, which is **to ensure your message is accurately heard, understood, and acted upon.**

Note, that this section is not speicifically directed towards public speaking or presenting. However, all the information provided here is still applicable to planned speaking contexts.

## Your Words

When you are just speaking in everyday situations, you should know what you want to accomplish (i.e., know your purpose) and know who you are speakign to (i.e., analyze your audience). The same tips that you learnt for writing in Sections 3.4 and 3.5 can be used here. Make sure the words you select will be understood by your audience, and serve your purpose. Additionally, speaking in shorter sentences will make it easier for people to process what you are saying and understand you better.
