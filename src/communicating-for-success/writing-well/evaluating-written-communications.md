One of the best ways to improve your writing skills is to objectively evaluate your writing and the writing of others. In this section, you are going to use a checklist to assess some written communications.

## Written Communication Evaluation Checklist

Here is a simple checklist that employs the 7Cs of Communication to help you evaluate the quality of written communication in a professional context. 

- **Clarity**
    - [ ]  Does the message use simple language, avoiding any terminology that is not likely to be known to the reader?
    - [ ]  Does the message say exactly what it means, without any room for ambiguity?
    - [ ]  Do the individual sentences in the message contain at most 1 or 2 thoughts?
- **Conciseness**
    - [ ]  Are there any unnecessary words or paragraphs that do not add to the intended purpose of the message?
    - [ ]  Are the conclusions and most important parts of the message highlighted?
- **Concreteness**
    - [ ]  Does the message avoid the use of vague or ambiguous words (e.g. "several", "very", "quickly", "usually")?
- **Correctness**
    - [ ]  Is the message free from typographical and grammatical errors?
    - [ ]  Does the message contain factually accurate information?
- **Coherence**
    - [ ]  Does the message lead with the most important points?
    - [ ]  Does the message follow a logical order?
    - [ ]  Are all arguments or claims supported with appropriate evidence?
