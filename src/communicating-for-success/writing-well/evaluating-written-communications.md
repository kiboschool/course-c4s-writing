## Evaluating Writing 

One of the best ways to improve your writing skills is to objectively evaluate your writing and the writing of others. In this section, you are going to use a checklist to assess some written communications.

## Written Communication Evaluation Checklist

Here is a simple checklist that employs the 7Cs of Communication to help you evaluate the quality of written communication in a professional context. 

- **Clarity**
    - Does the message use simple language, avoiding any terminology that is not likely to be known to the reader? 
    - Does the message say exactly what it means without any room for ambiguity?
    - Do the individual sentences in the message contain at most 1 or 2 thoughts?
- **Conciseness**
    - Is the message free from unnecessary words or paragraphs that do not add to the intended purpose of the message?
    - Are the conclusions and most important parts of the message easy to identify?
