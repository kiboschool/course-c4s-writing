*Estimted Time: 30 minutes*

The word coherence has been mentioned frequently in this course, and it is even one of the 7Cs of communication. However, we haven't discussed what it is in detail, how you can evaluate if your text is coherent, and what you can do to increase coherence. In this section, we will turn our focus to these topics, which will be instrumental in increasing the quality of your writing.

### Check Your Understanding - Coherence 1

> ‚ùì Read the two versions of the same paragraph below and answer the questions in the Padlet.


<details>
    <summary> Version 1 </summary>
    
The northern United States and Canada are places where herons live and breed. Spending the winter here has its advantages. Great Blue Herons live and breed in most of the northern United States. It‚Äôs an advantage for herons to avoid the dangers of migration. Herons head south when the cold weather arrives. The earliest herons to arrive on the breeding grounds have an advantage. The winters are relatively mild in Cape Cod.

    <summary> Version 2 </summary>
    
Great Blue Herons live and breed just about anywhere in the northern United States and most of Canada. When the cold weather arrives, the herons head south. A few come to Cape Cod where the winters usually aren‚Äôt too bad. Most of these herons are either inexperienced young birds or lost adult males too stubborn to ask for directions south. Spending the winter here has its advantages, and I‚Äôm not talking about the off-season parking in Provincetown. Herons are able to avoid the dangers of migration, plus they can be one of the earliest to arrive on the breeding grounds.

### Methods for Building Coherence

> üìñ [Read this article]](http://www.southeastern.edu/acad_research/programs/writing_center/handouts/pdf_handouts/coherence.pdf) on ways to improve the coherence of your writing by using repetition, transitional expressions, pronouns, synonyms, and parallel structures.

Alternate option: https://blog.penningtonpublishing.com/grammar_mechanics/ten-tips-to-improving-writing-coherency/

Here is a summary of the tips for building coherence that are given in the article:

1) Use a predictable paragraph structure
2) Use a comprehensible sentence structure
3) Employ repitition
4) Use effective sentence transitions
5) Use clear pronouns
6) Avoid dangling or misplaced modifiers
7) Use precise word choice
8) Use appropriate conjunctions
9) Limit passive voice
10) Be concise 

Above all else, logically ordering the sentences in a paragraph and the paragraphs in your text will build coherence that carries the reader through your writing more easily. When trying to assess if your sentences or paragraphs are logically ordered, ask yourself these questions:

- How does this sentence or paragraph relate to the previous one?
- How does this sentence or paragraph relate to the main topic and purpose of this piece of writing?
