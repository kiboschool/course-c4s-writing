# Creating Coherence
*Estimted Time: 30 minutes*

---

The word coherence has been mentioned frequently in this course, and it is even one of the 7Cs of communication. However, we haven't discussed what it is in detail, how you can evaluate if your text is coherent, and what you can do to increase coherence. In the remainder of this section, we will focus on these topics and the related concept of cohesion, which can serve as a helpful tool to improve the coherence of your writing.

Watch the following video on how to write with cohesion and coherence.

Read the two versions of the same paragraph below and answer the questions in the Padlet.

</aside>

- *Version 1*
    
    > The northern United States and Canada are places where herons live and breed. Spending the winter here has its advantages. Great Blue Herons live and breed in most of the northern United States. It’s an advantage for herons to avoid the dangers of migration. Herons head south when the cold weather arrives. The earliest herons to arrive on the breeding grounds have an advantage. The winters are relatively mild in Cape Cod.
    > 
- *Version 2*
    
    > Great Blue Herons live and breed just about anywhere in the northern United States and most of Canada. When the cold weather arrives, the herons head south. A few come to Cape Cod where the winters usually aren’t too bad. Most of these herons are either inexperienced young birds or lost adult males too stubborn to ask for directions south. Spending the winter here has its advantages, and I’m not talking about the off-season parking in Provincetown. Herons are able to avoid the dangers of migration, plus they can be one of the earliest to arrive on the breeding grounds.

### Methods for Building Coherence

<aside>


[Click here](http://www.southeastern.edu/acad_research/programs/writing_center/handouts/pdf_handouts/coherence.pdf) to read an article on ways to improve the coherence of your writing by using repetition, transitional expressions, pronouns, synonyms, and parallel structures.

</aside>

Above all else, logically ordering the sentences in a paragraph and the paragraphs in your text will build coherence that carries the reader through your writing more easily. When trying to assess if your sentences or paragraphs are logically ordered, ask yourself these questions:

- [ ]  How does this sentence or paragraph relate to the previous one?
- [ ]  How does this sentence or paragraph relate to the main topic and purpose of this piece of writing?

### Check Your Understanding

<aside>


❓ Read the three example paragraphs in the Padlet below, and rate their coherence and cohesion on a scale of 1 - 5 stars. (1 = poor; 5 = excellent).
Leave a comment on **at least one** of the examples with a recommendation for improving the coherence and cohesion.
