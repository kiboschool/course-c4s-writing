There is a common misconception that writing is not an important skill for professionals in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) fields. However, as mentioned in the video, technical professionals with poor writing skills often reduce the impact and effectiveness of their work. If no one can understand what you have done, the quality of your work can become irrelevant. 

This may be obvious in academia, where written articles are one of the main ways researchers share ideas and collaborate. However, it is also true in the technology industry, which is increasingly characterised by a global, distributed, remote-first workforce. For example, suppose you are based in Nairobi and work with colleagues in California. The 10 hour time difference means that you will rarely have meetings and will instead rely on written communications to share information, give instructions, and build relationships. 

As a consequence, communication skills consistently top the list of skills employers look for in job candidates.Â Vivek Ravisankar, CEO of HackerRank, the market leader for technical interviews, [notes](https://www.fastcompany.com/90588944/writing-skills-for-tech-workers) that the shift to hybrid and remote work means that "writing is the most important new skill for tech workers, regardless of role." Technical professionals write every day, from sending emails to their colleagues to creating product manuals for customers to drafting technical reports that summarise the outcomes of their work. As such, writing well has become a prerequisite for success in the [Future of Work](https://www.forbes.com/sites/gretasolomon/2018/08/09/why-mastering-writing-skills-can-help-future-proof-your-career/). 

## Discuss


> ðŸ’¬ Think back over your history of writing at school and work, and reflect on the following questions:
>
> - How do you feel when you sit down to write something?
> - Do you feel able to accurately evaluate the quality of your writing?
> - Has your writing helped (or hurt) your ability to accomplish an important goal? If so, how?
