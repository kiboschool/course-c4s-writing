## Final Project: Kibo Digital Literacy Fellowship (20% of Final Grade)


Expanding digital skills is an imperative for Africa. Technology is changing the nature of work, and companies in all sectors are increasingly digitizing their operations. African employers have a large, unmet need for employees with digital skills. According to a report by the International Finance Corporation and World Bank, by 2030, 50-55% of all jobs in Kenya will require digital skills, as will 35-45% of jobs in Nigeria and 20-25% of all jobs in Africa overall. The majority of demand is in “foundational digital skills,” such as web research, and mobile and online communication (page 10 of the report has a good summary of types of digital skills and examples). 

Yet, young Africans lack these skills. Boston Consulting group estimates that only 11% of African university graduates are well-trained in basic digital skills, and anecdotal reports support this. 

**How might we increase the foundational digital skills of Africans so that they can access the jobs of the future?**

The Kibo Digital Literacy Fellowship will provide a grant to support projects that directly increase the foundational digital skills of underserved Africans. Applicants are invited to support projects that will have a measurable impact on increasing the foundational digital skills.
