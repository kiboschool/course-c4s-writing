## 1) Final Project: Kibo Digital Literacy Fellowship Application (20% of Final Grade)

**Kibo Digital Literacy Fellowship Overview**

Expanding digital skills is an imperative for Africa. Technology is changing the nature of work, and companies in all sectors are increasingly digitizing their operations. However, African employers have a large, unmet need for employees with digital skills. According to a [report](https://www.ifc.org/wps/wcm/connect/b5ad161e-a2e2-4010-86f2-54717e68b239/Demand+for+Digital+Skills+in+Sub-Saharan+Africa_web.pdf?MOD=AJPERES&CVID=nEldzv7) by the International Finance Corporation and World Bank, by 2030, 50-55% of all jobs in Kenya will require digital skills, as will 35-45% of jobs in Nigeria and 20-25% of all jobs in Africa overall. The majority of demand is in ‚Äúfoundational digital skills,‚Äù such as web research, and mobile and online communication. 

Yet, young Africans lack these skills. Boston Consulting Group estimates that only 11% of African university graduates are well-trained in basic digital skills, and anecdotal [stories](https://twitter.com/ChetoManji/status/1409153757036826628) support this. 

So, **How might we increase the foundational digital skills of Africans so that they can access the jobs of the future?**

The Kibo Digital Literacy Fellowship will provide a grant to support projects that directly increase the foundational digital skills of underserved Africans. Applicants are invited to propose projects that will have a measurable impact on increasing the foundational digital skills for people in their  communities. Page 10 of the IFC and World Bank [report](https://www.ifc.org/wps/wcm/connect/b5ad161e-a2e2-4010-86f2-54717e68b239/Demand+for+Digital+Skills+in+Sub-Saharan+Africa_web.pdf?MOD=AJPERES&CVID=nEldzv7) gives some good examples of foundational digital skills, however proposals focusing on other foundational digital skills are welcomed.
