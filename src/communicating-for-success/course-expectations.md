## Using Technology

This course will require you to complete a lot of reading and writing, and there are now a lot of tools that you can use to support you in refining your skills.

### Word Processing: Google Docs

From previous assignments that Kibo students have turned in, it is evident that you are currently using a variety of tools when creating your written assignments (e.g. Notes, Notion). However, for C4S you should use **Google Docs** when completing all of your writing assignments, because it contains a lot of useful tools that will improve your writing process. If you don't have expereince using Google Docs, you can watch the video below to learn about its key features and how to get started quickly.

### Speech-to-Text: Google Docs Voice Typing

If you usually have trouble getting started with writing, a helpful technique is to turn the thoughts in your mind into concrete words on a page by just saying them aloud using a speech-to-text tool. One of the benefits of using Google Docs is that it has a built-in speech-to-text tool. 

You can supercharge this process by creating questions that you want your writing to answer and then use the voice typing tool to interview yourself in order to capture your thoughts to these questions down in written word. This can be a excellent way to **kick-start** your writing, if you tend to suffer from writer's block. You can learn more about how to use Google Doc Voice Typing by watching the video below.

### Google Docs Grammar and Spelling Checker

It is important to use a spelling and grammar checker when writing because it can help you catch typos and grammatical errors, and will improve the overall quality of your writing. Spelling and grammar mistakes can be distracting for readers and can make your writing seem careless or unprofessional. A spelling and grammar checker can help you identify and correct these mistakes, improving the clarity and credibility of your writing. In addition, using a spelling and grammar checker can help you improve your own language skills. By highlighting errors and suggesting corrections, a spelling and grammar checker can help you learn from your mistakes so that you can become a better writer.

### AI Writing Assistants: Grammarly, Wordtune, Quilbot, etc.

There are now a number of AI-powered tools that you can use to help with rewriting your sentences for clarity and impact. These work by reading the setnences that you have written, and suggesting re-writes to improve how your message is conveyed, which you have to review and decide on whether to accept or not. These tools are a powerful **supprt** to improve your writing, but they can't write for you. Nor should you just accept all their suggestions, without thouroughly evaluating them. Most of these tools will only allow you to access their full features if you pay, however they all provide some sort of limited free version.

> [Wordtune](https://www.wordtune.com/)

> [Quilbot](https://quillbot.com/)

**Note:** You should only be using these tools to improve the quality of your own writing. Copying the writing of others and passing it off as your own is called plagiarism, and this is a violation of the Kibo Student Code of Conduct and will result in disciplinary action. 

All of your submissions will be checked using a plagiarism tool that will be able to compare your work to writing found online. If you want to incoporate the writing of others into your work, be sure to quote, paraphrase, and cite your sources appropriately to avoid any plagiarism issues.

### Plagiarism Checker: Plagium

If you want to check your writing for plagiarism before you submit, there are a number of free tools like [Plagium](https://www.plagium.com/en/plagiarismchecker) that will allow you to check a limited number of words to determine how similar your work is to writing that can be found online.

---

#### Text-to-Speech: Natural Reader 

A text-to-speech app is a useful tool when working to improve your writing. The most obvious use for this tool is to allow you to "read" a large amount of text. However, there is a secondary use for such a tool that is acutally more pwoerful. Text-to-speech apps are useful when proofreading your writing because it is often easier to hear the mistakes in your text than to see them. Sometimes when we read, we are not actually reading, but instead remembering what we think the text says. Therefore, it can be hard to catch typos. However, when we listen to our writing, we are processing the words in a new way, and typos are far easier to identify.

## Attendance and Engagement Policies

Please make sure you have reviewed all the Kibo Academic Policies that are found in the [Catalog](https://bit.ly/ks-catalog-oct2022).

The general Kibo attendance and engagement policy is as follows:

Students are required to remain academically engaged during each week of the term. Academic engagement can include:
- Attending a scheduled session (e.g., live class or office hours) where there is opportunity for interaction with the instructor and/or peers
- Submitting an academic assignment, quiz, or project
- Taking an exam, or engaging in online tutorial or instruction
- Attending a study group that is assigned by the instructor
- Participating in an online discussion about academic matters
- Initiating contact with an instructor to ask a question about the class

Unless otherwise noted, the general requirement for participation and academic engagement is:
- No more than one unexcused week of non-engagement per term in any class
- No more than two excused (communicated in advance) weeks of non-engagement per term in any class

For this course specifically, you are expected to engage in the online discussion and reflection questions and activities that are embedded throughout the online lessons. 

You are also expected to attend the weekly 90 minute live class. If you are unable to attend the live class, you are required to notify the instructor at least 24 hours in advance of the live class that you will be missing, and you will be provided with an additional assignment to make up for the live class that you will not be attending. 

If you have any questions, please be sure to post them in the #help-c4s channel in Discord, and the instructor will be able to answer your question there.

## Academic Integrity

This course is run in accordance with Kibo School's Academic Honesty and Integrity Policy, which can also be found in the [Catalog](https://bit.ly/ks-catalog-oct2022). We have a zero tolerance policy towards all forms of academic misconduct, including cheating, plagiarism, and fabrication. If you are found to be in breach of the Academic Honesty and Integrity Policy in any of the assignments that you submit, you will be subject to disciplinary action. 

Note that assisting another student in the violation of this policy also constitutes a violation of academic integrity (e.g. letting someone copy your assignment counts as a violation for both the person that copied the work and the original owner of the copied work).

---
## Communication Expectations

The most effective way to communicate with the instructor for this course is through posting a message in the #help-c4s channel in Discord. All questions posted there will receive a response within 24 hours. 

All course announcements from the instructor will also be posted to the pinned announcement in the #help-c4s channel in Discord.
