Communication is a constant feature of our daily lives, so it can be easy to overlook what is occurring during the process. Therefore, before jumping into writing specifically, we are going to:

1. Discuss the **general process of communication**. 
2. Then, once we have a clear picture of the overall communication process, we will discuss the **different barriers that can lead to miscommunication**. 
3. Finally, we will conclude by exploring a simple framework that can help you **minimise the risk of miscommunication** in professional contexts.

- In its simplest form, the communication process is about **accurately getting the thoughts in the sender's head into the receiver's head.**
- There are a few key terms to know (*click the ‚ñ∑ to see the definitions*):
    - **Sender**
        
        The person that sends a message.
        
    - **Receiver**
        
        The person that receives a message.
        
    - **Message**
        
        The idea that is sent from the sender to the receiver.
        
    - **Encoding**
        
        The process of turning thoughts into a message.
        
    - **Decoding**
        
        The process of turning a message into thoughts.
        
    - **Channel**
        
        How the message is transmitted from the sender to the receiver.
        
    - **Communication Barrier (a.k.a. Noise)**
        
        Anything that impacts the communication process and influences how accurately a message is received.
        
    - **Context**
        
        The environment within which communication occurs. This includes the rules and expectations of the environment, as well as factors that are physical (e.g. location, setting), psychological (e.g. emotional state of the sender and receiver), and interpersonal (e.g. nature of the relationship between the sender and receiver).
        
- A simple picture of communication could look like this:
    
    ![Screen Shot 2021-10-21 at 1.21.40 PM.png](/communicating-for-success/introduction-to-the-communication-process/screen-shot-2021-10-21-at-1.21.40-pm.png)
    
    - In the above image, the person on the left (the sender) has a thought in her head about a shoe that needs to be cleaned, so she transmits a message to the receiver that says, "Clean the boot". The receiver gets the message and translates it into her own thoughts.
    - **But something went wrong!** The thoughts in the sender's mind and the receiver's mind are not the same.
    - Let's walk through the steps of the communication process to see how this happened.

### Steps of the Communication Process

**Step 1: Idea Formation**

- The communication process starts with a sender deciding that they have an idea or thought to communicate. In the example above, the sender has the thought of a boot in her head that she wants someone to clean.

**Step 2: Message Encoding**

- To communicate this thought, the sender must encode it into words, symbols, sounds, or gestures so that she has a message that can be transmitted. In the example, the sender writes the message: "Clean the boot".

**Step 3: Message Transmission**

- The message must now be transmitted from sender to receiver. In this example, let's assume that the sender writes the message as a text and sends it to the receiver via WhatsApp.

**Step 4: Message Decoding**

- The receiver gets the message and must decode it to determine the meaning and create a thought in her head. In the example, the receiver decodes the message and creates a thought in her head of a car boot.

**Step 5: Feedback**

- There is often a 5th step during which the receiver and sender check to ensure that the message was received as intended. However, in written communication, this is often harder to accomplish in real-time because the sender may not be present when the receiver is reading the message.
- In the example, the receiver does not have the thought in their head that the sender intended. Therefore, this communication failed. To remedy this, the receiver could send a feedback message to the sender to seek clarification and confirmation of their interpretation of the message.

**What do you think caused the miscommunication in the example?** 

It might be helpful to know that the sender is American and the receiver is British, and the word "boot" has different meanings in those two countries. 

This situation is a good reminder that there are many factors (called communication barriers or noise) that can impact the effectiveness of communication. Additionally, communication does not occur in a vacuum. There is always a context around communication that affects the barriers that could lead to miscommunication. 

This example may seem trivial. However, ineffective communication and miscommunication are common phenomena that can have severe consequences in professional contexts.

### Miscommunication

![Untitled](/communicating-for-success/introduction-to-the-communication-process/untitled.gif)

Miscommunication occurs when the message the receiver decodes does not match the original message that the sender intended. There are three general categories of miscommunication: 1) Sender-related, 2) Channel-related, and 3) Receiver-related. However, most miscommunications fall into the category of sender-related. To understand this category better, let's explore it through the analogy of two people playing catch (i.e. throwing a ball back and forth).

**Sender-related Miscommunication:** 

‚úçüèø The responsibility for effective communication sits with the sender. The sender is the one with the idea that they want to communicate and must do what is required to get the idea to the receiver as intended with minimal effort from the receiver. 

‚öæÔ∏è When playing catch, the person who throws the ball is responsible for throwing it so that the receiver can catch it. If the sender throws the ball over the receiver's head, and the receiver has to jump to catch it. It is the sender's fault if the ball is not caught.

‚úçüèø The sender needs to know their audience to tailor the delivery of their message to match their audience's interests, expectations, knowledge level, etc.

‚öæÔ∏è When playing catch, the thrower should know the skill level and habits of the person that they are throwing to so that they can throw the ball to them in a way that allows the catcher to catch it. For example, the thrower would throw the ball at a different height when throwing to someone that was 185 cm tall versus someone that was 150 cm tall.

‚úçüèø The sender should avoid distractions like incoherent narratives or grammar, spelling, and punctuation errors, which might make it harder for the receiver to understand the message as intended.

‚öæÔ∏è When playing catch, the thrower should avoid distractions (e.g., flashing lights, making too much noise) that might make it harder for the catcher to focus on the ball that is being thrown at them.

**A note on the other two categories:**

**Channel-related Miscommunication -** Miscommunications can also arise due to the channel that was chosen for conveying the message. The channel used can send unintended messages and influence how well the receiver can process the information and give feedback. Ultimately, a channel-related miscommunication could still be considered sender-related if the sender chose an inappropriate channel for their message. 

**Receiver-related Miscommunication -** While the sender holds most of the responsibility in communication, the receiver has a responsibility to focus their attention on the message sent to them. A receiver-related miscommunication occurs when they fail to do so. An example of a receiver-related miscommunication would be if someone gets a vital email with instructions for accessing the online content for a course, but they don't read the email due to a lack of motivation and thus are unable to follow the course instructions.

### Barriers to Communication

Several barriers can lead to miscommunications. These can be separated into the following categories: 1) Semantic, 2) Physical or Environmental, 3) Psychological or Attitudinal, which are presented in the image below with some examples.

![Screen Shot 2021-10-17 at 5.17.34 PM.png](/communicating-for-success/introduction-to-the-communication-process/screen-shot-2021-10-17-at-5.17.34-pm.png)

**Semantic barriers** occur because words can have different meanings to different people. This could be due to language or culture (as with the "boot" example), but it could also be due to the use of jargon or unfamiliar words. Such miscommunications can occur in professional contexts where acronyms and buzzwords are used to communicate concisely but result in miscommunication if, 1) the receiver is not aware of what the term means, or 2) the receiver and sender have different understandings of a word's meaning. Lack of clarity in writing can also lead to semantic barriers because the receiver may not be able to decode the message's meaning at all. 

**Physical and environmental barriers** are things like how much time someone has available to encode or decode a communication, things in the environment that cause distractions (e.g. noise, temperature, other people, spelling and grammatical errors), or the physical proximity between the sender and receiver. 

Similar to semantic barriers, the root of **psychological and attitudinal barriers** is that people are unique. People come into every interaction with distinct perspectives, interests, experiences, culture, cognitive abilities, etc. As a result, the attention they place on different communications, their attitude and emotional state, their assumptions, and their ability to process information varies significantly. This can lead to a mismatch between what the sender intended and what the receiver interprets.

While the communication process applies to communications that use any channel (e.g., face to face, over the phone, written, drawings, music, etc.), the focus of this course will be written communication, specifically in professional contexts. Numerous frameworks have been developed to help improve the likelihood of effective communication. One of these, the **7 Cs of Communication**, was created with the professional context in mind.
