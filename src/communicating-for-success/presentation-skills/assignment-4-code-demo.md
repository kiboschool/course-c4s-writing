## Brief

One afternoon you come into your local co-working space and notice a tech professional sitting across from your usual seat. They look like they are wrapping up their work and are about to head out. They are using a laptop with the sticker of your dream company on it, have a notebook with the company's logo on it, and wearing a t-shirt from the company as well. A signs point to the fact that they work at your dream company. Since it looks like they are heading out, you only have about 1 minute to speak with them. 

Record an elevator pitch that you could use for this interaction.

Remember the tips provided in the previous section on elevator tips, and make sure you include:

- Who you are
- A little background information about yourself
- Additional context about your background
- A connection to the listener
- What you are asking for
- A closing

Your elevator pitch should be between 30 - 60 seconds.

## Submission

Your submission should be the link to Youtube video of your elevator pitch video.

**Submit your assignment on Gradescope and then upload a copy to the Week 5 submission area on the Woolf platform.**
