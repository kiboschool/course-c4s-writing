üéâCongratulations! You have completed your first draft! Now it's time to let your **inner judge** loose to ensure that your writing achieves your purpose.

When we revise our drafts, we typically think about correcting things like grammar, spelling mistakes, and punctuation. However, these are lower-order concerns that you can manage later when editing. To get the most out of revising, you should start by focusing on the higher-order concerns around your content, how it's organised, and if it flows coherently at the service of achieving your purpose. 

To do this, read your draft and ask yourself the following questions:

- [ ]  What do I want to accomplish with my writing, and does it currently achieve that purpose?
- [ ]  Have I left out any information that would help me achieve my purpose?
- [ ]  Does my draft contain any content that should be removed because it doesn't help me achieve my purpose?
- [ ]  Are there places where my writing doesn't make sense?
- [ ]  Are the pieces of my writing in the correct order? Do they flow logically?

If you have gone through the [**Planning**](https://www.notion.so/Lesson-2-Planning-dd7a127e8b5544838bb877cb6b5e4272) and [**Structuring**](https://www.notion.so/Lesson-3-Structuring-e23d86bd76f04123b6fb9f79a9bef35f) steps, you should have all the information you need to answer these questions. The 7Cs of Communication are also useful here. While all the Cs are important, during revision, you can focus on:

- **Courtesy:** See things from the audience's point of view
- **Completeness**: Include all necessary information
- **Coherence:** Make it logical
- **Clarity:** Keep it simple

### Mindsets, Tactics, and Tools for Revising

When revising, a few mindsets, tactics, and tools can make the process more effective and efficient.

üß† **Mindsets**

- Pretend someone else wrote your draft and read it as a reader instead of its writer.
- Do not get emotionally attached to your words.

üõ†¬†**Tactics and Tools**

- Use [Reverse Outlining](/communicating-for-success/planning-structuring/creating-an-outline.md) to analyse the structure of your draft.
- Highlight key topics in each sentence and paragraph to see if you are repeating yourself
- Create a document to store any text you remove from your primary draft. This allows you to save text for future writing. Doing this can also make removing text from the primary draft easier because it doesn't feel like your words are being completely lost.
- Take a break between completing your draft and starting your revisions.
- Change how the document looks so that you can trick your brain into thinking it's an unfamiliar document. For example, try changing the font type, size, spacing, or colour.
- Give revising your complete focus by working somewhere quiet and free from distractions.
- Revise in short blocks so that you can maintain deep focus. Your concentration will naturally reduce over time, and trying to revise for extended periods will mean that your ability to identify issues will become less effective.

### Coherence (and Cohesion)

The word coherence has been mentioned frequently in this course, and it is even one of the 7Cs of communication. However, we haven't discussed what it is in detail, how you can evaluate if your text is coherent, and what you can do to increase coherence. In the remainder of this section, we will focus on these topics and the related concept of cohesion, which can serve as a helpful tool to improve the coherence of your writing.

Watch the following video on how to write with cohesion and coherence.

### Check Your Understanding

<aside>


Read the two versions of the same paragraph below and answer the questions in the Padlet.

</aside>

- *Version 1*
    
    > The northern United States and Canada are places where herons live and breed. Spending the winter here has its advantages. Great Blue Herons live and breed in most of the northern United States. It‚Äôs an advantage for herons to avoid the dangers of migration. Herons head south when the cold weather arrives. The earliest herons to arrive on the breeding grounds have an advantage. The winters are relatively mild in Cape Cod.
    > 
- *Version 2*
    
    > Great Blue Herons live and breed just about anywhere in the northern United States and most of Canada. When the cold weather arrives, the herons head south. A few come to Cape Cod where the winters usually aren‚Äôt too bad. Most of these herons are either inexperienced young birds or lost adult males too stubborn to ask for directions south. Spending the winter here has its advantages, and I‚Äôm not talking about the off-season parking in Provincetown. Herons are able to avoid the dangers of migration, plus they can be one of the earliest to arrive on the breeding grounds.

### Methods for Building Coherence

<aside>


[Click here](http://www.southeastern.edu/acad_research/programs/writing_center/handouts/pdf_handouts/coherence.pdf) to read an article on ways to improve the coherence of your writing by using repetition, transitional expressions, pronouns, synonyms, and parallel structures.

</aside>

Above all else, logically ordering the sentences in a paragraph and the paragraphs in your text will build coherence that carries the reader through your writing more easily. When trying to assess if your sentences or paragraphs are logically ordered, ask yourself these questions:

- [ ]  How does this sentence or paragraph relate to the previous one?
- [ ]  How does this sentence or paragraph relate to the main topic and purpose of this piece of writing?

### Check Your Understanding

<aside>


‚ùì Read the three example paragraphs in the Padlet below, and rate their coherence and cohesion on a scale of 1 - 5 stars. (1 = poor; 5 = excellent).
Leave a comment on **at least one** of the examples with a recommendation for improving the coherence and cohesion.
