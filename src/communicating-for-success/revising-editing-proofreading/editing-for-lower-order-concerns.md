Once you have revised your writing for higher-order concerns, it is time to focus on editing for lower-order concerns.

## Word Choice and Combatting Wordiness

Two other common errors to look for when editing are correcting word choice errors and removing unnecessary words. Managing these will make your writing more clear and concise.

ðŸ“º Watch the following video on word choice.

ðŸ“– Read [this chapter in Writing for Success](https://open.lib.umn.edu/writingforsuccess/chapter/4-3-word-choice/) to learn more about word choice.

</aside>

## Word Choice Checklist

When selecting a word to use, ask yourself the following questions:

- Is the word's connotation (i.e. the feeling that the word evokes) appropriate?
- Is this the best word for my purpose and context?
- Am I trying too hard to impress my reader?
- Do I really know what this word means? Should I look it up?
- Is this the easiest way to write this sentence? How would I say it to someone out loud?
- Is the word too specific? Does it cover all situations that I intend?
- Is the word too vague? Can it be interpreted in ways that I don't intend?
- Am I using any slang words or jargon that make my meaning unclear?

<aside>

ðŸ“º Watch the following video on how to manage wordiness and write more concisely.

</aside>

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RDpgpgsPc_k" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;"></iframe></div> 

As the video suggests, you should avoid:

- **Deadwood** - Words and phrases that take up space but add no meaning.
- **Utility Words** - Filler words that donâ€™t contribute to the meaning of a sentence. 
    - Words with imprecise meanings (e.g. factor, aspect)
    - Meaningless adjectives (e.g., good, bad, important)
    - Meaningless adverse (e.g., basically, quite)
- **Circumlocution** - Using a roundabout way to say something.
- **Wordy Phrases** - Using more words in a phrase than necessary.

A simple trick you can use to reduce wordiness is to try removing a word or phrase you think might be wordy. If the meaning of your sentence stays the same without the word or phrase, then you don't need it in your text.

## Creating an Editing Checklist

Two of the most powerful tactics for editing are to:

1. **Create a checklist of your editing steps.** Use this checklist when editing to ensure that your process is systematic.
2. **Edit for your known weaknesses.** Create a list of grammar and mechanics mistakes you know you frequently make. Add these mistakes to your editing checklist so that you can be sure to look for them during your editing process.

**Here is an example of what your editing checklist could look like:**

- Did I spell-check?
- Did I check homophones?Â (e.g., to, too, two)
- Did I look up difficult words to ensure I am using them correctly?
- Are all my sentences complete?
- Did I use one verb tense throughout (unless there was a good reason to shift tense)?
- Do I have any run-on sentences or comma splices?
- Am I missing any commas?
- Does my writing flow when read aloud?
- Did I use different sentence lengths and types to make my writing sound interesting?
- Are there any words or phrases that I can remove without altering the meaning of my text?
- Is my punctuation correct through out my writing?
