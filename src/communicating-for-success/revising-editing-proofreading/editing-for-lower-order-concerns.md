*Estimated Time: 1 hour*

üó£ **"Few of my novels contain a single sentence that closely resembles the sentence I first set down. I just find that I have to keep zapping and zapping the English language until it starts to behave in some way that vaguely matches my intentions."**

Once you have revised your writing for higher-order concerns, it is time to focus on editing for lower-order concerns.

## Mindsets, Tactics, and Tools for Editing

- Remember the [7Cs of Communication](/communicating-for-success/writing-well/evaluating-written-communications.md)!
- Create a checklist for your editing process. See more on this below.
- Create a list of your common errors so you can edit for your known weaknesses. See more on this below.

## Word Choice and Combatting Wordiness

Two other common errors to look for when editing are correcting word choice errors and removing unnecessary words. Managing these will make your writing more clear and concise.

<aside>

üì∫ Watch the following video on word choice.

<aside>

üìñ Read [this chapter in Writing for Success](https://open.lib.umn.edu/writingforsuccess/chapter/4-3-word-choice/) to learn more about word choice.

</aside>

## Word Choice Checklist

When selecting a word to use, ask yourself the following questions:

- Is the word's connotation (i.e. the feeling that the word evokes) appropriate?
- Is this the best word for my purpose and context?
- Am I trying too hard to impress my reader?
- Do I really know what this word means? Should I look it up?
- Is this the easiest way to write this sentence? How would I say it to someone out loud?
- Is the word too specific? Does it cover all situations that I intend?
- Is the word too vague? Can it be interpreted in ways that I don't intend?
- Am I using any slang words or jargon that make my meaning unclear?

<aside>

üì∫ Watch the following video on how to manage wordiness and write more concisely.

</aside>

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RDpgpgsPc_k" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;"></iframe></div> 

As the video suggests, you should avoid:

- **Deadwood** - Words and phrases that take up space but add no meaning.
- **Utility Words** - Filler words that don‚Äôt contribute to the meaning of a sentence. 
    - Words with imprecise meanings (e.g. factor, aspect)
    - Meaningless adjectives (e.g., good, bad, important)
    - Meaningless adverbs (e.g., basically, quite)
- **Circumlocution** - Using a roundabout way to say something.
- **Wordy Phrases** - Using more words in a phrase than necessary.

A simple trick you can use to reduce wordiness is to try removing a word or phrase you think might be wordy. If the meaning of your sentence stays the same without the word or phrase, then you don't need it in your text.

## Tone and Style

> üìñ Read the following section on [tone and style](https://opentextbc.ca/buildingblocks/chapter/tone-and-style/)


## Check Your Understanding: Analyzing Tone

> ‚ùì The examples are excerpts from job application cover letters. Read through each example and determine if it uses an appropriate tone. Add your thoghts to the padlet below in the appropriate column, with a justification for your decision.

<details>
    <summary> Example 1 </summary>
    
I read your ad for the assistant position and would really love to apply. As my resume shows you, I have tons of great experience. And, in my honest opinion, I was born to do this job. Please review my resume and call me soon to schedule an interview. I am super eager to meet you. Hope to see you soon!
    
</details>

<details> 
    <summary> Example 2 </summary>
    
I am applying for your opening for the Environmental Projects Coordinator position. Please let me explain why I am such a good match.

As a little girl, my two brothers and I used to go camping with my parents. We were taught to respect nature, and to this day there is nothing I love more than camping and the great outdoors. I even joined the girl scouts when I was young, so I could improve my camping and nature skills. I am proud to say that I earned many badges. Then, when I got older, I got caught up in trying to make money, and wound up spending the next ten years of my life working in accounting. I did well and got great reviews, but my heart wasn't in it. I used to sit and think about my next vacation, always feeling like something was missing. And today, when I saw the listing for your job, I knew I had to write to you. I could feel it in my bones that your organization and this job were the right direction for me ‚Äî something I should have done ages ago.

Since I read about your job, it's all I can think of. I really hope you are willing to give me a chance. I know if you do, I will have found the right job for me at last.

Please consider me seriously, despite my coming from a different background. I know I can do the job, and what I don't know yet I will learn quickly. Scout's honor!

## Creating an Editing Checklist

Two of the most powerful tactics for editing are to:

1. **Create a checklist of your editing steps.** Use this checklist when editing to ensure that your process is systematic.
2. **Edit for your known weaknesses.** Create a list of grammar and mechanics mistakes you know you frequently make. Add these mistakes to your editing checklist so that you can be sure to look for them during your editing process.

**Here is an example of what your editing checklist could look like:**

- Did I spell-check?
- Did I check homophones?¬†(e.g., to, too, two)
- Did I look up difficult words to ensure I am using them correctly?
- Is the tone of my writing appropriate for my audience and purpose?
- Are all my sentences complete?
- Did I use one verb tense throughout (unless there was a good reason to shift tense)?
- Do I have any run-on sentences or comma splices?
- Am I missing any commas?
- Does my writing flow when read aloud?
- Did I use different sentence lengths and types to make my writing sound interesting?
- Are there any words or phrases that I can remove without altering the meaning of my text?
- Is my punctuation correct through out my writing?
