## Instructions

The first step of the midterm project is for you to select a product idea. This product can be a completely be a fictional product, a current side project, or a product that you are working on in one of your other classes. Your task for the C4S midterm project will be to write a press release and FAQ page for your selected product. You will do so by:

- Answering the following planning questions:
  
  - **Determine your purpose:** What is the purpose of your press release? What do you want to accomplish?

  - **Analyse your audience:** Who is the audience of your press release and how do you need to adapt your writing to that audience?
  
  - **Gather your information:** What information and evidence do you need to include in your writing to achieve your purpose?
  

- Create an outline for your press release. Your press release should includes the following details, but you can decide how you want to order this information:

    1) Detailed description of your product, how it works, and and how it addresses the customer needs.
    2) Headline that includes the product name.
    3) A call to action for the reader of the press release that states how they can get started with the product.
    4) One sentence subheading that describes your customers and the core beenfit of the product.
    5) A fictional testimonial quote from a customer that has used your product.
    6) A fictional quote from someone in the company about why the company decided to solve this problem with this product.
    7) Description of the problem that your product is designed to solve.
    8) Summary of the benefits of the product.

CIRCULERT APP ALERTS SHOPPERS WHEN THE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES THEY WANT BECOME AVAILABLE OR DROP IN PRICE

If a product or service isn‚Äôt available today or at the right price, Circulert helps shoppers buy it later, for less.

SEATTLE‚ÄìJanuary 1, 2021 - Circulert, a Seattle company, today launched a new application for iOS and Android that notifies users when the products and services they want or need become available for sale or drop in price. 

Many items consumers want to buy aren‚Äôt available today, or the price might not be quite sharp enough to prompt a purchase. If there‚Äôs a specific brand of clothing you like, you have to keep checking retailer websites so see if they‚Äôve released a new line, or spend time looking through a slew of daily emails from every retailer you‚Äôve ever shopped from to find the one email that tells you about new products you care about. How often have you found out that your favorite band is playing a show in your town after all the tickets are sold out? How often have you picked through ‚Äúweb specials‚Äù of your favorite clothing line when they go on discount, only to find that the only sizes still available of that one product you love are XXL of XXS? Too often.

Circulert solves these problems by telling you when you can buy the things you want, or buy the things you want at the price you want. No more work. No more missing out. Circulert learns about the products and services you care most about, and then sends you only the notifications you want. You can choose the notification style or frequency, or view a feed of recent alerts. You are in control. At launch, Circulert can send you availability or price drop notifications for products like clothing, music, or books from your favorite brands, artists or authors. Circulert can also tell you when your favorite band schedules a show in your town, when a flight between you and your long-distance partner is a screaming deal, or when the price of that sweet new tech bauble drops below the amount your spouse is likely to notice on the credit card statement.

‚ÄúOur goal with Circulert is to take the hassle out of buying things later,‚Äù said Ian McAllister, creator of Circulert. ‚ÄúThere are tens of thousands of retailers on the web selling everything imaginable. Circulert helps consumers filter out the noise and all the stuff they don‚Äôt need, and helps them get the things they do need at the best price, saving them time and money.‚Äù

To try out Circulert, go to Circulert.com and download the app for iOS or Android. Connect the app to your Amazon, Ticketmaster, and other online accounts, and then review the suggested alerts. Circulert will then send you only highly relevant notifications when the items you want are available at the right price. You can star items that you want to get back to easily, share them with friends and family, or follow through and buy them.

 ‚ÄúI absolutely hate missing out on a great deal,‚Äù said Clare Keating, a nurse in Seattle. ‚ÄùTo make sure I don‚Äôt miss out I used to have to hit my favorite websites every few days. With Circulert, I found out about great deals right away and never miss out.‚Äù

If you want to save time or money (or both!), visit circulert.com today.
