*Estimated Time: 30 minutes*

> üó£ **"Most people are so engrossed in the message they are trying to convey that they forget to step out of themselves and think about the reader. The most effective communicators try to visualise the person reading and reacting to their writing."**

**Guiding question:** Who will read my writing, and what implications does this have on achieving my purpose?

Determining your purpose and determining your audience is a chicken and egg situation. What you want to accomplish with your writing can influence who the ideal audience should be. But, at the same time, the audience you select can affect what you want to achieve. Therefore, as you are thinking about the purpose of your writing, also think about the audience.

Remember that you can think of communication as a game of catch, where the sender throws a message to the receiver. At the very least, the sender must know who will be receiving their message so that they can aim it at them. Additionally, recall that the sender's responsibility is to ensure that the receiver can catch their message. To do so, the sender must understand the receiver (e.g., their interests, skill level, abilities) to tailor their throw accordingly. Gaining this understanding requires intentionality and consideration before writing and can be accomplished by identifying and analysing your audience.

### Identifying Your Target Audience

When identifying your target audience, you can ask the following questions:

- How big is my audience? (e.g., One person, a small group, the entire company, the general public)?
- Are there multiple audiences? If so, who is most important?
- Is there a secondary audience that may read my message and influence the target audience or be impacted by the target audience's actions?
- What do I know about my audience (e.g., age, gender, cultural background, interests, biases, or concerns), and how could these factors impact how they receive my message?
- What is my professional or personal¬†relationship¬†with the audience? And how does this impact the expected formality of my message?
