## Planning 

Planning is the first step of the writing process. The goals of the planning step are to 1) clarify the purpose of your writing, 2) think about who your audience is and how you can adapt your writing to them, 3) gather the information that you will need to support your writing, and 4) identify the best channel to transmit your writing —all before you start creating the content of your message.

### Typical Tasks

- Determine the purpose of the writing
- Determine the audience of the writing and their interests and needs
- Determine the topic of the writing
- Gather information that you might need to achieve your purpose
- Select an appropriate communication channel

### Typical Problems

- Drafting content without planning first
- Unclear purpose, or too many competing purposes
- Lack of audience awareness
- Selecting the wrong audience for the chosen purpose
- Not having the information needed to support your purpose
- Selecting the wrong channel for communication

## Structuring

Structuring is the next step of the writing process, and the goal is to determine how to organise your information to achieve your chosen purpose for your specific audience.

### Typical Tasks

- Select a coherent organizing pattern that supports the purpose of your writing
- Create an outline to guide the drafting process

### Typical Problems

- Use of chronological order as opposed to a more appropriate logical order
- No narrative, therefore it is hard to follow the thought process
- Paragraphs that lack coherence
