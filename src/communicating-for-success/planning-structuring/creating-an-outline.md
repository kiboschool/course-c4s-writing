# Creating an outline

*Estimated Time: 30 minutes*

ðŸ—£ "**Even if I'm writing something as brief as a one-page letter, I like to jot down some sort of outline. It may consist of no more than three or four words or phrases: the essence of thought I want to get across and the order in which I intend to build my message."**

- Donald Walton

An outline is a valuable tool to employ while deciding on an appropriate organising pattern that best serves your purpose. Outlines help you see the relationship between your ideas, see how your organisation pattern looks in practice, and determine if your approach creates a coherent message. However, the crucial part of the outlining stage, and what differentiates it from merely selecting an organising pattern, is the act of labelling your ideas so that you can see a systematic overview of your message before you fill in the detailed content. If you created a [mind-map during the planning step](/communicating-for-success/planning-structuring/gather-your-information.md), you might already have the beginnings of an outline.

You might have learnt about creating an outline for an essay in an academic context, but it is helpful in a professional context as well. When writing an email, it is tempting to jump into drafting the text, but creating a simple outline before you start can ensure that your email achieves its purpose while still being clear, coherent, and concise. Once you have an outline that conveys your information in an order that fulfils your purpose, you can fill in the content of each section to create the full text of your message.

### Example: Outlining an Email

Here is an example of how you can use an outline to structure an email draft. We will start with the planning step to show how planning and structuring can work well together, even when drafting something as simple as an email.

**Step 1: Planning**

**Purpose:** Welcome students to the Future Proof with Python course and give them essential instructions ahead of the Orientation session.

**Audience:** Future Proof with Python enrolled students

**Required** **Information**: All links; Course requirements; Session dates and times; Discord introduction details.

**Channel:** Email

**Step 2: Structuring**

**Organisation Pattern:** Description; Order of Importance.

**Outline**

1. Greeting and context
2. Critical Information
    1. Dates and timing of course
    2. Course requirements
        1. Laptop
        2. Environment
        3. Stable internet connection
3. Less critical Information
    1. Join Discord
    2. Complete Discord introduction
4. What to do if you have any questions
5. Sign off

**Resulting Email Draft**

### Reverse Outlining

Creating an outline before writing your first draft might get in the way of some people's preferred text creation process. Therefore there is also an option to use "reverse outlining" to get the benefits of outlining if you have already begun writing. Reverse outlining is when you isolate the main points of a piece of writing by removing the supporting content. As a result, you go from "full text to outline" instead of "outline to the full text". You can create a reverse outline using one of the following approaches:

- **Topic sentence approach:** *Write down the topic sentence from each paragraph.*
- **One sentence summary approach:** *Write a one-sentence summary of each paragraph that expresses the paragraph's main idea.*
- **Two sentence summary approach:** *Write a two-sentence summary of each paragraph that expresses the paragraph's main idea and function (e.g. to compare, to propose, to persuade, to describe, to give background information).*
- **Idea by idea approach:** *Write down the distinct ideas (e.g. main idea plus any supporting or additional ideas) presented in each paragraph as complete sentences. There might be more than one idea per paragraph.*
    
    

When you have finished creating your reverse outline, you can analyse the results by asking the following questions:

- Do multiple paragraphs share the same main idea?
- Do any paragraphs have multiple main ideas?
- Do any paragraphs lack a clear main idea?
- Are there any main ideas that don't connect clearly and directly back to the topic and purpose of the text?
- Do the main ideas flow from paragraph to paragraph? Or are there gaps in the reasoning and logic?
- Do the main ideas use any of the organising patterns described in [Section 3.1](/communicating-for-success/planning-structuring/organising-patterns.md)?

You can then use your answers to the above question to determine if you need to add, remove, or reorder any content to make your writing more coherent.

    > My fascination with technology was sparked when, as a child I thought it would be a great idea to take apart my Playstation console. Aware of the danger, I was still eager to see how it all worked inside. I find it intriguing how fast society has been shaped and continues to be, by the influence of Computer Science. A few years ago if someone were to have claimed that cars would become autonomous, people would have doubted them. Now we are at a stage where nearly anything is possible and this is due to the relentless problem solving of computer scientists. The latest software update released by Tesla motors allows their cars to learn how to drive themselves, and is an example of artificial intelligence, a sector which I am most interested in. I want to study Computer Science because I want to gain the knowledge needed to be able to help find solutions to world problems, with the efficient use of computer technology. With the knowledge and skills I will attain from this course, the creative ideas that I could bring into fruition would be endless. I hope to become one of the computer scientists who adapt technology to help the human race evolve. One possibility would be for artificially intelligent gadgets to recognise different people and adjust to their individual needs based on personal preferences. I have been teaching myself Objective-C syntax in my spare time and have completed online programming courses, which have allowed me to explore the endless possibilities that computer science can bring to the world. I have also learnt to create a simple iOS game using Appleâ€™s syntax called â€˜Swiftâ€™, in XCode alongside Photoshop.

    > I understand that computer science is not just about programming and hardware but also about the ethics entailed in the process of a design as well as innovative thinking. Studying A-Level Philosophy and Ethics has given me an insight into many ethical situations that may arise around computer science such as the creation of artificial intelligence. This raises controversy of whether or not we should be trying to create artificial intelligence, as people have different beliefs and faiths. One example of such controversy was during the development of Hondaâ€™s Asimo robot when engineers had to visit the Vatican to seek permission to continue the project due to how human-like the robot was developed to walk. During a week of volunteering on NCS I visited Wazoku, the creators of an idea-sharing software used by major corporations such as Waitrose and The BBC. I was given an insight into the working environment that I hope to join after completing my degree. I am applying for work experience at Wazoku, in order to learn about how the software industry can influence the progress of companies.

    > I am constantly seeking to learn new skills and gain experience from various activities. I have been a member of the RAF Air Cadets for four years, where I have learnt many valuable life skills such as discipline, leadership, charity and confidence. Alongside these life skills I have gained various qualifications such as The St. Johnâ€™s Ambulance Youth First Aid qualification and Leading Cadet qualification. Being a cadet also involved doing charity work such as raising money for the RAF Benevolence Fund and the Poppy Appeal. Through all these experiences I have learnt how to work with people from all walks of life, different backgrounds and people who have different beliefs and ideas to the ones I do. This has enabled me to adjust my approach to solving different problems and situations.

I am inspired by the fact that computer science has become a fundamental element in the development of a better, smarter future for our world and my goal is to be part of that development process.
