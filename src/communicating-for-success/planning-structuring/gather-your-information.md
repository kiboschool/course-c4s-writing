### Benefits of Gathering Information When Planning

<aside>


ðŸ“– When we sit down to write, we often forget to gather the required information ahead of time, leading to situations like this:

> I know it's happened to you. You've bought something that needs assemblingâ€”a swing set, a ceiling fan, or a bookcaseâ€¦ you just start working. Soon you discover that you need a tool or part that you don't have, so work stops while you make a trip to a hardware store. An hour later you're back on the job, and it happens again. Again, you stop work to go buy what you need. The one-hour job stretches into three or four hours.

I know it's happened to you because it's happened to me. And it happens to most of us when we writeâ€¦we jump into writingâ€¦without making sure that we have the materialsâ€”the informationâ€”that we need. We get halfway into the first paragraph and realize that we need a number from Alice in Accounting, so we stop to call her. In the third paragraph we remember that we need a product description from an online catalogue, so we open a Web browserÂ and find it. As a result of such interruptions, the job takes longer, and the writing is less effective.

If we built houses this way, we'd buy our nails in one little rack package of two or three dozen nails at a time. When we used up each package, we'd stop work to go buy another package. Fortunately, real builders don't work this way. They buy their nails by the box or keg, and they try to buy enough for the whole job before they start driving nails into boards.

That's what we need to do as writers. As much as possible, we need to collect the information we need before we start drafting.

There are numerous benefits to gathering required information in the planning step:

- It gives you the chance to focus on the information to ensure that it is accurate.
- It allows you to analyse the strength of your argument and evidence.
- It reduces interruptions during the drafting phase, leading to more continuity and speed during text creation.

Later on, when you draft and revise your text, you may find that additional information is needed. This is fine and to be expected. However, gathering information in the planning stage can reduce the amount of other information you need to collect later. While also helping you strengthen the content and structure of your writing.

### Determining the Information Needed

- The first set of broad questions to ask yourself when gathering information for your writing is:
    - What is the main topic of my writing? And what is my scope?
    - What do I understand about this topic?
    - What does my audience need to know about this topic?
- When considering the information required to answer those broad questions, it can be helpful to ask yourself the [six W/H](https://www.yourthoughtpartner.com/blog/bid/53902/the-5-ws-and-an-h-to-communicate-virtually-anything) of your topic and purpose:
    - Who?
    - What?
    - Where?
    - When?
    - Why?
    - How?
- Also, think about if you are making any claims in your writing that require supporting evidence. Using evidence and supporting information will make your writing clear and concrete.
    - e.g., You are writing a university application essay, and you want to write that you "have a passion for technology". What evidence and details could you include to support that claim?
    - e.g., You are writing a report on a new product that your team launched, and you want to write that "the launch was successful". What evidence do you need to include to support that claim?
- Finally, it can also be helpful to use the five pairs of questions shown below to determine additional information you might need to support the claims in your message. These questions will help you gather the information that aligns with some of the text organising patterns that you will learn about in [Lesson 3](/communicating-for-success/planning-structuring/organising-patterns.md).
    
    
    | Same: How is this topic like others? | Different: How is this topic different from others? |
    | --- | --- |
    | Whole: Is this topic part of a larger whole?  | Parts: Can this topic be divided into parts? |
    | Time: When does this topic exist? | Space: Where does this topic exist? |
    | Cause: What is the cause of this topic? | Effect: What is the effect of this topic? |
    | Pros: What are the advantages of this topic? | Cons: What are the disadvantages of this topic? |
- In this information-gathering step, it is ok to gather more information than you eventually need for the text that you will create. However, this informal research phase is helpful because it can also help you ensure that you understand the topic you are writing about.
- This information-gathering step will follow a more formal and systematic research approach for certain types of writing (e.g. research papers, journal articles, data analysis reports). However, since this course is focused on effective written communication in professional contexts, exploring formal research methods is beyond our scope.

### Organising Your Information

As you are gathering your information, you can organise and visualise it using a mind map. To create a mind-map, start by writing your main topic or purpose in the centre of a piece of paper. Then, as associations come to mind, you can draw them out from that starting point. The result will be an image like the one shown below, which can be a great starting point for [creating an outline](/communicating-for-success/planning-structuring/creating-an-outline.md) to structure your text.
