**Question to ask yourself when selecting a communication channel:**

- Is my message formal or informal?
- Will the information in my message need to be referenced in the future? Does it require a permanent record?
- Am I relaying confidential information?
- Am I relaying time-sensitive information?
- Am I communicating with an individual or a group?
- Does my message require a response?
- Has the receiver requested the information be sent through a specific channel?
- Does the receiver have a preferred communication channel?
- Is there a cost associated with the different communication channels at my disposal?

You are working with two office mates on a market report. Both have been bad lately about submitting their work on time, and you‚Äôre starting to worry about meeting the next major milestone a few days from now. Neither has been absent because you can see them in their offices as you walk by in the hallway.

<details>
    <summary> Scenario 3 </summary>
