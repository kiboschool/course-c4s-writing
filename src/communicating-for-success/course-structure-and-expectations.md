Communication skills refer to the ability to effectively exchange information, ideas, and thoughts through speaking, writing, and other forms of communication.

There are several types of communication skills, including:
- **Writing:** the ability to write clearly and effectively, using proper grammar, spelling, and punctuation.

- **Reading:** the reciprocal ability to writing that enables you to understand the meaning of written words, letters, and symbols.
 
- **Speaking:** the ability to speak clearly and effectively, using appropriate language and tone.

- **Listening:** the reciprocal ability to speaking that involves actively listening to others to understand the messages that they are communicating.

- **Nonverbal communication:** the use of body language, facial expressions, and other nonverbal cues to convey meaning and facilitate communication.

These are all actions that we repeatedly perform each day, and it's easy to take them for granted. Have you ever stopped to reflect on how well you do each of these things? Do you think about how your competence in these skills impacts your performance and relationships at home, school, or work? Are you intentional about your approach to these forms of communication? 

Robin Sharma once said, “Awareness precedes choice, and choice precedes change.” The goal of C4S is to help you develop an awareness of what effective and efficient communication looks like, insight into your current skill level, and frameworks for improving your skills so that they can support you in achieving your goals.

C4S contains three different parts, during which we will focus on a specific component of communication. Each phase of the course will be described below in more detail.

**Part 1 (week 1) - Reading**

Reading is an important part of communication because it allows us to receive and understand written messages from others. It is a key way that we can gain knowledge and information, and it is also a way that we can communicate back to others through written language. Reading enables us to understand and interpret written texts, which can be anything from emails and news articles to novels and poetry. The ability to effectively recieve information in written format, is a first step to benig able to send back appropriate responses. Reading is also an important part of language development and literacy, as it helps us learn new words and expand our vocabulary. It is also an important skill for learning and academic success, as it allows us to understand and absorb new concepts and ideas.

Specifically, reading can definitely help improve your writing skills. When you read, you are exposed to a wide variety of writing styles, language structures, and vocabulary. This can help you develop a sense of what works and what doesn't in terms of writing, and can also help you expand your own writing style and vocabulary. In addition, reading can help you understand the conventions of writing in different genres and disciplines, which can be useful when you are writing in a specific style or for a specific audience. Overall, reading is a great way to learn about effective writing and to develop your own writing skills.

With this in mind, the course starts with an exploration of how to read well, so that you can build a strong foundation for the other communication skills that we will explore afterwards.
