## Course Topics

Communication skills refer to the ability to effectively exchange information, ideas, and thoughts through speaking, writing, and other forms of communication.

There are several types of communication skills, including:
- Speaking: the ability to speak clearly and effectively, using appropriate language and tone.

- Listening: the ability to actively listen to others and understand their perspective.

- Nonverbal communication: the use of body language, facial expressions, and other nonverbal cues to convey meaning and facilitate communication.

- Writing: the ability to write clearly and effectively, using proper grammar, spelling, and punctuation.

- Reading: the reciprocal ability to writing that enables you to understand the meaning of written words, letters, and symbols.

These are all actions that we repeatedly perform each day, and it's easy to take them for granted. Have you ever stopped to reflect on how well you do each of these things? Do you think about how your competence in these skills impacts your performance and relationships at home, school, or work? Are you intentional about your approach to these forms of communication? 

Robin Sharma once said, “Awareness precedes choice, and choice precedes change.” The goal of C4S is to help you develop an awareness of what effective and efficient communication looks like, insight into your current skill level, and frameworks for improving your skills so that they can support you in achieving your goals.

## Using Technology

This course will require you to complete a lot of reading and writing. There are a number of Text-to-Speech tools that can support you with reading large amounts of text, and a number of Speech-to-Text tools that can support you with transcribing your words into written format. Below is one recommendation in each of these categories. However, you are encouraged to do your own research to find additional tools that might better meet your specific needs.

## Attendance and Engagement

Please make sure you have reviewed all the Kibo Academic Policies that are found in the [Catalog](https://bit.ly/ks-catalog-oct2022).

The general Kibo attendance and engagement policy is as follows:

Students are required to remain academically engaged during each week of the term. Academic engagement can include:
- Attending a scheduled session (e.g., live class or office hours) where there is opportunity for interaction with the instructor and/or peers
- Submitting an academic assignment, quiz, or project
- Taking an exam, or engaging in online tutorial or instruction
- Attending a study group that is assigned by the instructor
- Participating in an online discussion about academic matters
- Initiating contact with an instructor to ask a question about the class

Unless otherwise noted, the general requirement for participation and academic engagement is:
- No more than one unexcused week of non-engagement per term in any class
- No more than two excused (communicated in advance) weeks of non-engagement per term in any class

For this course specifically, you are expected to engage in the online discussion and reflection questions and activities that are embedded throughout the online lessons. 

You are also expected to attend the weekly 90 minute live class. If you are unable to attend the live class, you are required to notify the instructor at least 24 hours in advance of the live class that you will be missing, and you will be provided with an additional assignment to make up for the live class that you will not be attending. 

If you have any questions, please be sure to post them in the #help-c4s channel in Discord, and the instructor will be able to answer your question there.

## Academic Integrity

This course is run in accordance with Kibo School's Academic Honesty and Integrity Policy, which can also be found in the [Catalog](https://bit.ly/ks-catalog-oct2022). We have a zero tolerance policy towards all forms of academic misconduct, including cheating, plagiarism, and fabrication. If you are found to be in breach of the Academic Honesty and Integrity Policy in any of the assignments that you submit, you will be subject to disciplinary action. 

Note that assisting another student in the violation of this policy also constitutes a violation of academic integrity (e.g. letting someone copy your assignment counts as a violation for both the person that copied the work and the original owner of the copied work).

---
## Assignment Deadlines
All weekly assignments have a stated assignment deadline on their assignment page by which the assignment must be submitted in order to get full marks. Late submissions will be subject to at least a 25% deduction in the marks available.
