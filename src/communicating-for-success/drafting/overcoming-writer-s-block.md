ðŸ—£ **"A draft is a prototype. It's not the final product. It's not written for the reader, it's written for the writer. It's "quick and dirty." It's written to test. It's written to see if it does what it planned to do."**

- Kenneth Davis

Using the writing process, we have separated the text creation step (i.e. drafting) from the planning and structuring steps that come before and the revising and editing steps that come after it. **Therefore, when drafting, you can "just write".** 

But writing can be hard at times. For example, we often face writer's block, during which we cannot put any words on the page. For you to overcome this, it is essential to go into the drafting step with two mindsets:

1. Think of the draft as a prototype meant for you to see how well your plan works.
2. Remember that it's ok to do it badly at first. Your first draft doesn't have to be perfect. You will improve your writing during the revising step. However, you can't revise if you don't have any text written down in the first place.

Listen to the following podcast on limiting your critic/judge early on in your writing process.

**This should remind you of the [Flowers Paradigm from Lesson 1](/communicating-for-success/writing-well/writing-as-a-process.md)!**

ðŸ—£ "**Do not expect the writing to come out right the first time. Do not be afraid of the possibility that what you write will fail to live up to your expectations, or those of the schoolteacher on your shoulder. Anything you write can be changed. Anything you write can be thrown away. You have nothing to lose."**

### Verbalising Your Thoughts

If you have trouble getting started with writing, a helpful technique is to turn the thoughts in your mind into concrete words on a page by just saying them aloud. To do this, you can record a voice note using your phone and then transcribe the voice recording manually. Or you can use an application like [Otter](https://otter.ai/) or even Google Doc's voice typing tool. 

You can supercharge this process by using the outcomes of your planning step to create questions that you want your writing to answer. You can then order these questions based on your outline, and then use voice typing, a voice-to-text app, or transcription to record someone interviewing you with the questions so that you can capture your answers as written words. If you don't have someone available to interview you, you can interview yourself. Having these transcribed thoughts is a great starting point for your first draft.
