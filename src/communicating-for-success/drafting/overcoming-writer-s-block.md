# Overcoming Writing Roadblocks

*Estimated Time: 1 hour*

---

Using the writing process, we have separated the text creation step (i.e. drafting) from the planning and structuring steps that come before and the revising and editing steps that come after. **Therefore, when drafting, you can "just write".** 

But writing can be hard at times. When it comes to actually putting "pen to paper", it is common to feel anxious, which can lead to an unwillingness or inability to create text. In this section, we will learn about some of the roadblocks that can get in the way of drafting, starting with an exploration of why we sometimes get anxious when writing.

## Understanding Writing Anxiety

There are a number of things that can cause anxiety when writing. These include:

- Inexperience with the type of writing task

- Negative or limiting beliefs about your writing abilities or interests (e.g. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not a good writer‚Äù; ‚ÄúI hate writing.‚Äù)
- Immediate deadlines
- Distant deadlines
- Lack of interest in the task or topic
- Personal problems or life events that make it hard to focus on the writing task

## Understanding and Overcoming Writer's Block

One specific type of writing roadblock that people often experience is called "writer's block". during which we cannot put any words on the page. For you to overcome this, it is essential to go into the drafting step with two mindsets:

1. Think of the draft as a prototype meant for you to see how well your plan works.
2. Remember that it's ok to do it badly at first. Your first draft doesn't have to be perfect. You will improve your writing during the revising step. However, you can't revise if you don't have any text written down in the first place.

üì∫ Watch the following video to learn the cause of writer's block and how to overcome it.

üó£ "**Do not expect the writing to come out right the first time. Do not be afraid of the possibility that what you write will fail to live up to your expectations, or those of the schoolteacher on your shoulder. Anything you write can be changed. Anything you write can be thrown away. You have nothing to lose."**

## Drafting Techniques

<aside>

üó£ **"A draft is a prototype. It's not the final product. It's not written for the reader, it's written for the writer. It's "quick and dirty." It's written to test. It's written to see if it does what it planned to do."**

- Kenneth Davis
