## Overcoming Writer's Block

<aside>


üó£ **"A draft is a prototype. It's not the final product. It's not written for the reader, it's written for the writer. It's "quick and dirty." It's written to test. It's written to see if it does what it planned to do."**

- Kenneth Davis
</aside>

Using the writing process, we have separated the text creation step (i.e. drafting) from the planning and structuring steps that come before and the revising and editing steps that come after it. **Therefore, when drafting, you can "just write".** 

But writing can be hard at times. For example, we often face writer's block, during which we cannot put any words on the page. For you to overcome this, it is essential to go into the drafting step with two mindsets:

1. Think of the draft as a prototype meant for you to see how well your plan works.
2. Remember that it's ok to do it badly at first. Your first draft doesn't have to be perfect. You will improve your writing during the revising step. However, you can't revise if you don't have any text written down in the first place.

üó£ "**Do not expect the writing to come out right the first time. Do not be afraid of the possibility that what you write will fail to live up to your expectations, or those of the schoolteacher on your shoulder. Anything you write can be changed. Anything you write can be thrown away. You have nothing to lose."**
