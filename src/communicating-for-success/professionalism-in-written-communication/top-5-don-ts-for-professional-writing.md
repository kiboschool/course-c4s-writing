## Top 10 Dos

When writing in a professional context, do:

1 - Identify and clearly state your goals

2 - Use the right/appropriate tone

3 - Keep it simple and succinct

4 - Save your best written documents as templates for future use

5 - Have someone proofread your writing

6 - Make your writing easy to read and skim

7 - Be professional

8 - Write with the reader in mind

9 - Structure and organize your writing

10 - Be concise and stay on topic
    - Delete redundant adjectives. All friends are personal; all innovations are new; all disasters are serious.
    - Don’t disguise your verbs as verb/noun pairs. Don’t “make a decision” or “carry out an improvement.” Just “decide” or “improve.”
    - Cut windy phrases. Why say “We are in the process of upgrading our IT systems” when you can simply say “We are upgrading our IT systems”?
