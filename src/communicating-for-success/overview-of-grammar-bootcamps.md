## Purpose of Grammar Bootcamps

Grammar is important for a number of reasons. Proper grammar allows you to communicate your ideas clearly and effectively. It also helps to ensure that your sentences are easy to understand and free from ambiguity. In addition, good grammar is important for making a good impression on others. In academic and professional settings, poor grammar can make you appear careless or unprofessional. Furthermore, grammar is important for understanding written materials. When reading, we rely on the correct use of grammar to help us make sense of the words on the page. If the grammar is incorrect, it can be difficult to understand the intended meaning of the text.

Overall, good grammar is essential for clear and effective communication. It is also important for understanding written materials and making a good impression on others. Therefore, you will work on improving your grammar throughout the duration of this course.

During the first 6 weeks of C4S, you will come across a grammar bootcamp at the start of each of the weekly lessons. The purpose of these bootcamps is to give you practice in understanding and correctly applying grammar rules, so that you can improve the quality of your writing. It is improtant to note that while, there are a lot of rules that you can learn to improve the grammatical correctness of your writing, this course is not a grammar course, so we will not dive deeply into grammar rules. Instead, we will focus on the most common errors that distract readers and reduce the clarity of messages. These common errors are:

1. **Misused homonym or homophone**: Using a word that sounds similar to the intended word but is spelt differently or has a different meaning.

*Example:* Using "there" instead of "their" or "affect" instead of "effect." For example, "Their going to the store" should be "They're going to the store."

2. **Fragment**:Â Using an incomplete sentence that is not a completed thought. 

*Example:* "Because of the rain." is an incomplete sentence. It can be correct to "Because of the rain, the party was canceled."

3. **Run-on sentence**: Using two independent clauses without the appropriate punctuation.

*Example:* "Shola enjoyed the bouquet of tulips John gave her however she prefers roses." is a run on sentence. It can be corrected to "Shola enjoyed the bouquet of tulips John gave her. However, she prefers roses."

4. **Misplaced modifier**: Placing a modifier (e.g., adjective, adverb, or modifying phrase) too far from the word it modifies so that it looks like it is modifying another word.

*Example:* "After the run, she arrived home and fell ontoÂ the sofa covered in sweat." has the modifying phrase "covered in sweat" in the wrong place, so that it seems to be modifying the sofa. The correct sentence would be "After the run, she arrived homeÂ covered in sweatÂ and fell onto the sofa."

5. **Verb form or tense error**:Â Using the wrong form or tense of a verb.

*Example:* Confusing subject-verb agreement: This occurs when the subject and verb of a sentence do not agree in number. For example, "The student are in the library." should be "The student is in the library."

*Example:* Using incorrect verb tense: This occurs when the verb tense does not match the time frame being described in the sentence. For example, "Yesterday I walk to the store." should be "Yesterday I walked to the store."


6. **Comma splice**:Â Using a comma when sentences should not be joined with a comma.

*Example:* "I love going to the beach, it's so relaxing." should be "I love going to the beach. It's so relaxing." 

7. **Missing comma**: Not using a comma when one is required. 

*Example:* 

8. **Apostrophe error**: Including an apostrophe when one isn't needed or omitting an apostrophe when one is required.

*Example:* 

9. **Wrong preposition**: Using the wrong preposition.

*Example:* 


10. **Unclear pronoun**:Â Ambiguity around what noun a pronoun (e.g. he, she, they) replaces.

*Example:*

The grammar bootcamps will cover examples of the above error types rather than give you the grammar theory to memorise upfront. 

In each grammar bootcamp, there are quizess that present questions about different grammatical conventions. Each quiz ends once you get ten questions correct or your exhaust the available questions. At the start of each quiz, you will be asked to pick a number. This will determine how many questions you have available, so choose wisely!

Once you have completed a quiz for a section, you should have seen numerous examples of how to use the corresponding grammar conventions. Feel free to take the quizzes as many times as you like. If you want to learn more about a grammar convention and its correct usage, after each quiz, there are links to additional theory in video and text formats. 

**The grammar bootcamps are designed to be personalised to your grammar needs. So please interact with them in whatever way is most useful for you. Do as many or as few of the quizzes as you see fit. And do them as many times as is helpful.** The additional resources provided also have more questions that you can use to test your understanding of the different grammar conventions.

If you encounter a question in one of the quizzes and don't understand the correct answer, post the question in Discord to get additional clarification from your peers or the instructor.
